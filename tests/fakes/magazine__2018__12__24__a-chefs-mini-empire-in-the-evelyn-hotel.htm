After two meals at Benno, I felt exhausted by the pomp and circumstance. One night, I mistook the contents of a vase on my table for reed-shaped fragrance diffusers; they turned out to be spindly breadsticks, or “housemade grissini,” seasoned with Calabrian chili and herbes de Provence. A canapé of duck liver and smoked-eel terrine atop black-olive purée—sprinkled with caramelized cocoa nibs and served with a shooter of lukewarm butternut-squash consommé, as sweet as an Italian-soda syrup—came off like a “Top Chef” challenge gone wrong. Even pastas, including a lovely green garganelli in a veal-and-porcini ragù, were fussy, served in plates shaped like U.F.O.s, with nowhere to rest your silverware should you want to pause for a sip of a fantastically fruity Nebbiolo.<span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span><span class="html-tag">&lt;div <span class="html-attribute-name">class</span>="<span

I would almost go back just for the simple coddled egg, cooled with a dollop of black-truffle mousseline and garnished with tiny fingerling potatoes, pioppini mushrooms, and leeks. Each mussel, clam, and beautiful rhombus of squid in the brodetto, or seafood stew, for two was perfectly cooked. Dessert was a high point: a flaky miniature babka, with coffee-cardamom gelato; an al-dente baked apple, with granola and tart-apple sorbet. But who wouldn’t roll their eyes at the coffee service, which involves a waiter standing tableside as he weighs grounds on a scale, explains the temperature of the water, and expounds on the mechanics

It’s a warm, lively extension of the hotel’s beautiful lobby. Pasta—including a wonderful spinach-noodle-and-bolognese lasagna—is served in the usual tableware. Though the menu can be uneven—the burger with hot peppers and provolone was a bit dry one night, and beware the cacio-e-pepe ravioli, which sounds too good to be true for a reason—it’s generally imbued with a sense of curiosity and excitement about unpretentious Italian cooking. An impressive array of housemade salumi and regional specialties like tigelle, a kind of embossed flatbread from Modena, for slathering with thrillingly spicy charred-eggplant dip, are worth a visit. It’s the sort of food you can imagine Jonathan Benno preparing at the end of a long night, kicking off his shoes and relaxing at home. <span class="html-tag">&lt;em <span class="html-attribute-name">class</span>=""&gt;</span>(Benno tasting menu $95-$145.

It’s a warm, lively extension of the hotel’s beautiful lobby. Pasta—including a wonderful spinach-noodle-and-bolognese lasagna—is served in the usual tableware. Though the menu can be uneven—the burger with hot peppers and provolone was a bit dry one night, and beware the cacio-e-pepe ravioli, which sounds too good to be true for a reason—it’s generally imbued with a sense of curiosity and excitement about unpretentious Italian cooking. An impressive array of housemade salumi and regional specialties like tigelle, a kind of embossed flatbread from Modena, for slathering with thrillingly spicy charred-eggplant dip, are worth a visit. It’s the sort of food you can imagine Jonathan Benno preparing at the end of a long night, kicking off his shoes and relaxing at home. ",["em","(Benno tasting menu $95-$145.

past July, on the final day of the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," summit in Brussels, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, proposed a closed-door emergency meeting. The emergency was Donald Trump. Minutes earlier, the President had arrived late to a session where the Presidents of Ukraine and Georgia were making their case to join ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"],". Trump interrupted their presentation and unleashed a verbal assault on the members of the alliance, calling them deadbeats and free riders on American power. Trump threatened to go his “own way” if they didn’t immediately pay more for their own defense. His barrage centered on Merkel, Europe’s longest-serving democratic leader."],["p","“You, Angela,” Trump chided Merkel. Most of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"],"’s members had failed to fulfill the goal of spending two per cent of G.D.P. for defense, but Trump focussed on Germany’s military spending of just over one per cent of G.D.P. In front of television cameras the previous day, he had accused Germany of being “totally controlled by Russia,” because of a proposed new gas pipeline. His tweets that day sounded like blackmail. “What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.”"],["p","Now, with the room cleared of staff, the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," leaders sat stunned by what one called the “bizarre spectacle” of Trump’s harangue. It fell to another woman, Dalia Grybauskaitė, the President of Lithuania, to defend Merkel. Germany had sent troops to protect Lithuania from Russia, Grybauskaitė pointed out, and Merkel was committed to spending more on ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"],"’s common defense. The Danish and the Norwegian Prime Ministers also pushed back. In the corner of the room, Merkel strategized with other Europeans about how to stop Trump. Eventually, Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, offered the President what he appeared to want most: a way to claim victory. Rutte noted that, since Trump took office, the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," allies had collectively raised their defense budgets by some seventy billion dollars. Take the win, he urged the President. Trump did just that."],["p","And yet, when he emerged from the meeting and spoke with reporters, Trump lied, claiming not only that his allies had capitulated to him but also that they would consider his demand to raise their annual military spending to four per cent of G.D.P., an assertion so politically impossible that Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, immediately issued a public rebuttal. Trump, of course, went on behaving in his erratic, inexplicable manner. As he left the summit, he interrupted the Chancellor while she was addressing her fellow ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," leaders, and kissed her. “I love this woman,” he said. “Isn’t she great?” A senior German official who told me about that particular Trumpian flourish resisted any attempt at full understanding. “It’s up to psychologists and historians what to make of that,” he said. Four days later, Trump ended his European tour in Helsinki. There, standing next to Vladimir Putin, he spoke with bewildering sympathy for Russian foreign policy, ill-concealed contempt for his ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," partners, and implausible skepticism about his own intelligence services."],["p","The astonishing week in Europe was the culmination of a four-month period in which the President imposed tariffs on allies by calling them “national security” threats, pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, which they had jointly negotiated with the United States, and held affectionate summits with two of the world’s most powerful autocrats, Putin and Kim Jong Un, while casting aspersions on America’s most constant allies. No one was more of a constant target than Angela Merkel."],["p","European leaders now worry that Trump’s illiberal aims go well beyond his insistent demands on Merkel to pay more for ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," and stop shipping so many cars to the U.S. “Many European leaders have told me that they are convinced that President Trump is determined to destroy the E.U.,” a former senior U.S. official told me. Trump has begun publicly calling the E.U. a “foe,” and promoting the resurgence of nationalism, which Macron and Merkel see as a direct threat. Trump’s Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, in a recent speech at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, attacked the United Nations, the E.U., the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, and derided what he called Europe’s flawed vision of multilateralism as “an end to itself.”"],["p","Europe has had many fights with American Presidents over the years, but never in the seven decades since the end of the Second World War has it confronted one so openly hostile to its core institutions. Since Trump’s election, Europe’s leaders have feared that it would come to this, but they have disagreed about how to respond to him. Many hoped to wait Trump out. A few urged confrontation. Others, especially in nations more vulnerable to Russia, urged accommodation. (Poland offered to name a new military base Fort Trump.) Macron tried flattery, and then, when that failed, he reverted to public criticism of Trump-style nationalism."],["p","The challenge from Trump has been especially personal for Germans, whose close relationship with the United States has defined their nation’s postwar renaissance. Merkel grew up in Communist East Germany and credits the United States as essential to the liberation of the East and to German reunification. As the head of Europe’s largest and wealthiest nation, she has sought to guide the Continent through the standoff with Trump, but has struggled, because the President’s harsh words reflect a painful truth: Europeans are dependent on the United States for their security and increasingly divided as Putin’s Russia threatens the nations in the east. “Not all of what he says is wrong,” said the senior German official, one of ten who spoke with me. “Europe has been free-riding for some time.” Asked for comment about Trump’s criticism of Merkel, a White House spokesperson told me, “He is often toughest on his friends, and he considers her one. He views Germany as a powerful, prosperous country that should be doing more on defense spending.” But the risks for Trump are also considerable: call your friends enemies long enough, and eventually they may start to believe you. Is this, then, finally, the end of Pax Americana?"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOn%20November%2016%2C%202016%2C%20eight%20days%20after%20Trump%20was%20elected%2C%20Barack%20Obama%20flew%20to%20Berlin%20to%20meet%20with%20Merkel%3B%20it%20was%20the%20last%20foreign%20trip%20of%20his%20Presidency.%20Obama%20and%20Merkel%20had%20not%20started%20out%20as%20good%20friends%2C%20but%20they%20had%20become%20as%20close%20as%20two%20public%20figures%20could%20be.%20Over%20dinner%20in%20the%20Adlon%20Hotel%2C%20they%20discussed%20the%20shocking%20events%20of%20the%20previous%20few%20months%2C%20particularly%20Great%20Britain%E2%80%99s%20referendum%20to%20leave%20the%20European%20Union%20and%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20victory%20running%20on%20the%20slogan%20%E2%80%9CAmerica%20First.%E2%80%9D%20Through%20the%20windows%20of%20their%20private%20dining%20room%2C%20Merkel%20and%20Obama%20could%20see%20the%20floodlit%20Brandenburg%20Gate%2C%20the%20symbol%20of%20a%20reunified%20Berlin.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMerkel%2C%20who%20was%20nearing%20the%20end%20of%20her%20third%20term%2C%20confided%20that%20she%20reluctantly%20felt%20that%20she%20had%20to%20run%20again%2C%20in%20order%20to%20be%20a%20buffer%20against%20Trump%2C%20Brexit%2C%20and%20the%20surge%20of%20right-wing%20populism%20throughout%20Europe.%20Obama%20urged%20her%20to%20do%20so.%20%E2%80%9CObama%20was%20obsessed%20with%20the%20fate%20of%20Europe%20during%20his%20last%20year%20in%20office%2C%E2%80%9D%20Charles%20Kupchan%2C%20who%20served%20as%20Obama%E2%80%99s%20top%20National%20Security%20Council%20adviser%20on%20European%20affairs%20and%20accompanied%20him%20on%20the%20trip%2C%20told%20me.%20After%20the%20election%2C%20the%20situation%20seemed%20even%20more%20urgent.%20%E2%80%9CHis%20view%20was%20that%20Merkel%20was%20needed%20to%20keep%20Europe%20together%2C%E2%80%9D%20Kupchan%20said.%20%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20afraid%20that%2C%20without%20Merkel%2C%20Humpty%20Dumpty%20was%20going%20to%20fall%20off%20the%20wall.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20dinner%20was%20emotional.%20Obama%20later%20told%20Benjamin%20Rhodes%2C%20his%20deputy%20national-security%20adviser%2C%20that%20he%20had%20said%20to%20Merkel%20that%20the%20Trump%20Presidency%20would%20be%20like%20a%20storm.%20Obama%20told%20her%20to%20just%20%E2%80%9Ctry%20to%20find%20some%20high%20ground%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20hold%20on%20to%20it%2C%20Rhodes%20recalled%20to%20me.%20By%20the%20time%20they%20said%20good%20night%2C%20three%20hours%20later%2C%20it%20was%20the%20longest%20that%20Obama%20had%20been%20alone%20with%20another%20world%20leader%20in%20his%20eight%20years%20in%20office.%20In%20an%20adjoining%20room%2C%20advisers%20to%20Merkel%20and%20Obama%20were%20concluding%20their%20own%20dinner.%20Rhodes%20offered%20a%20rueful%20toast%3A%20To%20Angela%20Merkel%2C%20he%20said%2C%20now%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20leader%20of%20the%20free%20world.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ERhodes%20was%20not%20the%20first%20to%20bestow%20this%20title%20on%20Merkel.%20When%20%3Cem%3ETime%3C%2Fem%3E%20named%20her%20its%20Person%20of%20the%20Year%2C%20in%202015%2C%20it%20called%20her%20%E2%80%9CChancellor%20of%20the%20Free%20World%2C%E2%80%9D%20citing%20her%20decision%20to%20take%20in%20more%20than%20a%20million%20refugees.%20Merkel%E2%80%99s%20immigration%20policy%20infuriated%20Trump%2C%20and%20he%20seized%20on%20it%20to%20help%20define%20his%20candidacy%20for%20the%20White%20House.%20%E2%80%9CI%20told%20you%20%40TIME%20Magazine%20would%20never%20pick%20me%20as%20person%20of%20the%20year%2C%E2%80%9D%20Trump%20tweeted.%20%E2%80%9CThey%20picked%20person%20who%20is%20ruining%20Germany.%E2%80%9D%20He%20often%20brought%20the%20Chancellor%20up%20on%20the%20campaign%20trail%20in%202016%2C%20saying%20at%20a%20rally%20in%20March%2C%20%E2%80%9CWhat%20Merkel%20did%20to%20Germany%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20sad%2C%20sad%20shame.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBefore%20the%20election%2C%20Henry%20Kissinger%20had%20visited%20Berlin%2C%20and%20he%20advised%20German%20officials%20to%20arrange%20a%20meeting%20with%20Jared%20Kushner%2C%20which%20they%20did%2C%20although%20the%20German%20policy%20%C3%A9lite%2C%20like%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20world%2C%20didn%E2%80%99t%20think%20Trump%20would%20win.%20%E2%80%9CWe%20were%20extremely%20poorly%20prepared%20for%20this%2C%E2%80%9D%20Wolfgang%20Ischinger%2C%20the%20former%20German%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20States%2C%20who%20now%20heads%20the%20Munich%20Security%20Conference%2C%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9CI%20think%20everybody%20has%20been%20in%20quite%20a%20state%20of%20shock.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAfter%20Trump%20was%20elected%2C%20other%20world%20leaders%20schemed%20to%20play%20golf%20with%20Trump%20or%20schmooze%20him%20at%20Trump%20Tower.%20Merkel%2C%20for%20her%20part%2C%20released%20a%20statement%2C%20at%20once%20congratulating%20the%20President-elect%20and%20subtly%20announcing%20their%20differences.%20It%20spoke%20of%20%E2%80%9Ccommon%20values%2C%E2%80%9D%20including%20%E2%80%9Cdemocra

November 16, 2016, eight days after Trump was elected, Barack Obama flew to Berlin to meet with Merkel; it was the last foreign trip of his Presidency. Obama and Merkel had not started out as good friends, but they had become as close as two public figures could be. Over dinner in the Adlon Hotel, they discussed the shocking events of the previous few months, particularly Great Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union and Trump’s victory running on the slogan “America First.” Through the windows of their private dining room, Merkel and Obama could see the floodlit Brandenburg Gate, the symbol of a reunified Berlin."],["p","Merkel, who was nearing the end of her third term, confided that she reluctantly felt that she had to run again, in order to be a buffer against Trump, Brexit, and the surge of right-wing populism throughout Europe. Obama urged her to do so. “Obama was obsessed with the fate of Europe during his last year in office,” Charles Kupchan, who served as Obama’s top National Security Council adviser on European affairs and accompanied him on the trip, told me. After the election, the situation seemed even more urgent. “His view was that Merkel was needed to keep Europe together,” Kupchan said. “He was afraid that, without Merkel, Humpty Dumpty was going to fall off the wall.”"],["p","The dinner was emotional. Obama later told Benjamin Rhodes, his deputy national-security adviser, that he had said to Merkel that the Trump Presidency would be like a storm. Obama told her to just “try to find some high ground,” and hold on to it, Rhodes recalled to me. By the time they said good night, three hours later, it was the longest that Obama had been alone with another world leader in his eight years in office. In an adjoining room, advisers to Merkel and Obama were concluding their own dinner. Rhodes offered a rueful toast: To Angela Merkel, he said, now “the leader of the free world.”"],["p","Rhodes was not the first to bestow this title on Merkel. When ",["em","Time"]," named her its Person of the Year, in 2015, it called her “Chancellor of the Free World,” citing her decision to take in more than a million refugees. Merkel’s immigration policy infuriated Trump, and he seized on it to help define his candidacy for the White House. “I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year,” Trump tweeted. “They picked person who is ruining Germany.” He often brought the Chancellor up on the campaign trail in 2016, saying at a rally in March, “What Merkel did to Germany, it’s a sad, sad shame.”"],["p","Before the election, Henry Kissinger had visited Berlin, and he advised German officials to arrange a meeting with Jared Kushner, which they did, although the German policy élite, like the rest of the world, didn’t think Trump would win. “We were extremely poorly prepared for this,” Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German Ambassador to the United States, who now heads the Munich Security Conference, told me. “I think everybody has been in quite a state of shock.”"],["p","After Trump was elected, other world leaders schemed to play golf with Trump or schmooze him at Trump Tower. Merkel, for her part, released a statement, at once congratulating the President-elect and subtly announcing their differences. It spoke of “common values,” including “democracy, liberty, respect of the law and of human dignity.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c12cee8ef12204ae0c0605f%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c12cee8ef12204ae0c0605f%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c12cee8ef12204ae0c0605f%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c12cee8ef12204ae0c0605f"}]],["p","The foreign-policy establishment, in both Washington and Berlin, told Merkel and her advisers that Trump was sometimes unpredictable and volatile, but not an existential threat. He was ignorant, but would be constrained by his staff. He didn’t really mean what he said. One veteran of Republican Administrations recommended “strategic patience,” telling a senior German diplomat to ignore the tweets and focus on policy. Other Europeans received similar advice and came to similar conclusions. Rob Malley, a senior Obama adviser on Europe, who now heads the International Crisis Group, said, of the French, “Their view was that you shouldn’t take irreversible steps as the result of a reversible Presidency.”"],["p","From the start, Merkel entertained no illusions that Trump could be easily managed. Still, she had surmounted serious differences with Trump’s two predecessors, George&nbsp;W. Bush and Obama, and became close partners with both. When Merkel took office, in late 2005, Germany had not moved past its antipathy for Bush, whose invasion of Iraq had opened a rift with her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder. But Merkel and Bush got along, and their unlikely friendship was captured for the cameras when Bush gave her a back rub at a G-8 summit. With Obama, a decisive moment came in 2014, when Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. Obama and Merkel worked together to form a coherent response to Putin’s aggression, imposing sanctions and demanding peace talks. By 2016, they spoke as often as once a week and had what advisers for both leaders told me was a genuine personal and intellectual connection."],["p","Russia figured heavily in the dinner conversation at the Adlon: Trump was threatening to abandon the Ukraine policy and embrace Putin. Obama’s lobbying that night to get Merkel to run for a fourth term was, I’ve been told by German sources, critical in her considerations. “I think the Chancellor listened very carefully to what [Obama] said,” a senior German official told me. As Rhodes recounts in his memoir, “The World as It Is,” when Obama left the country, on November 18th, he thought he saw a tear rolling down Merkel’s face as she said goodbye. Obama turned to Rhodes and said, “Angela, she’s all alone.” Two days later, Merkel announced that, because of “insecure times,” she was running again. However, she cautioned those who hoped that she would be a foil for Trump and the Trump-friendly forces throughout Europe: “No person alone, not even the most experienced, can turn things to good in Germany, Europe, and the world, especially not a Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EA%20few%20days%20before%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Inauguration%2C%20John%C2%A0B.%20Emerson%2C%20Obama%E2%80%99s%20Ambassador%20to%20Germany%2C%20met%20for%20the%20last%20time%20with%20Merkel%20in%20her%20glass-walled%20office%20on%20the%20seventh%20floor%20of%20the%20Chancellery%2C%20in%20Berlin.%20%E2%80%9CMy%20advice%20was%3A%20get%20to%20Washington%20as%20fast%20as%20possible%20and%20build%20a%20personal%20relationship%20with%20him%2C%20because%20that%E2%80%99s%20how%20Trump%20operates%2C%E2%80%9D%20Emerson%20recalled.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20March%2C%20Merkel%20flew%20to%20Washington%20for%20her%20first%20meeting%20with%20Trump.%20She%20%E2%80%9Chad%20never%20prepared%20longer%20or%20harder%20for%20an%20initial%20meeting%20with%20a%20head%20of%20government%20than%20for%20her%20first%20meeting%20with%20President%20Trump%2C%E2%80%9D%20one%20of%20her%20top%20national-security%20aides%20told%20a%20fellow-diplomat.%20Merkel%20studied%20a%201990%20%3Cem%3EPlayboy%3C%2Fem%3E%20interview%20with%20the%20future%20President%2C%20which%20has%20become%20something%20of%20a%20runic%20text%20for%20Trumpologists%20on%20both%20sides%20of%20the%20Atlantic.%20She%20also%20watched%20episodes%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20NBC%20reality%20show%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%2C%E2%80%9D%20read%20his%201987%20book%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Art%20of%20the%20Deal%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20spoke%20with%20Canada%E2%80%99s%20Prime%20Minister%2C%20Justin%20Trudeau%2C%20who%20had%20recently%20met%20one-on-one%20with%20Trump.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20first%20Trump-Merkel%20encounter%20in%20the%20Oval%20Office%20began%20with%20almost%20comically%20awful%20optics%3A%20Merkel%20offered%20a%20ceremonial%20handshake%20for%20the%20cameras%2C%20which%20Trump%20seemed%20to%20rebuff.%20After%20the%20photographers%20left%20the%20room%2C%20Trump%20reportedly%20announced%2C%20%E2%80%9CAngela%2C%20you%20owe%20me%20one%20trillion%20dollars.%E2%80%9D%20(A%20White%20House%20spokesperson%20denied%20that%20Trump%20used%20that%20language%2C%20but%20acknowledged%20that%20he%20shared%20the%20sentiment%20with%20the%20Chancellor.)%20Steve%20Bannon%2C%20the%20hard-line%20nationalist%20who%20was%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20chief%20strategist%20at%20the%20time%2C%20had%20asked%20the%20National%20Security%20Council%20to%20come%20up%20with%20a%20number%20to%20dramatize%20how%20much%20more%20money%20would%20have%20gone%20to%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ENATO%3C%2Fem%3E%20since%202006%20if%20the%20allies%20had%20been%20spending%20two%20per%20cent%20of%20their%20G.D.P.%20on%20defense%2C%20according%20to%20Ivo%20Daalder%20and%20James%C2%A0M.%20Lindsay%E2%80%99s%20book%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Empty%20Throne.%E2%80%9D%20This%20calculation%20ignored%20the%20fact%20that%20the%20two-per-cent%20goal%20isn%E2%80%99t%20supposed%20to%20take%20effect%20until%202024%2C%20never%20mind%20that%20the%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ENATO%3C%2Fem%3E%20allies%20don%E2%80%99t%20%E2%80%9Cowe%E2%80%9D%20Trump%20anything.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMerkel%20intended%20to%20talk%20about%20Putin%20and%20the%20threat%20posed%20by%20his%20dream%20of%20Russia%E2%80%99s%20retaking%20former%20Soviet%20territory.%20She%20brought%20with%20her%20a%20handout%20prepared%20for%20Trump%2C%20who%20she%20knew%20disdained%20lengthy%20briefing%20papers.%20It%20included%20a%20map%20that%20showed%20the%20borders%20of%20the%20Soviet%20bloc%20in%201982%2C%20overlaid%20with%20Putin%E2%80%99s%20current%20territorial%20ambitions.%20Trump%20was%20unmoved.%20Merkel%20later%20told%20others%20that%20he%20had%20interrupted%20her%20efforts%20to%20discuss%20Russia%20in%20order%20to%20boast%20about%20his%20poll%20ratings%20among%20Republican%20voters.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20President%20and%20the%20Chancellor%20are%20almost%20epically%20mismatched.%20Merkel%20is%20a%20trained%20scientist%2C%20who%20declined%20a%20teaching%20position%20because%20she%20refused%20to%20inform%20on%20her%20colleagues.%20She%20has%20a%20distinctly%20analytical%20cast%20of%20mind%2C%20and%20she%20has%20tried%20to%20reason%20with%20Trump%2C%20or%20to%20explain%20complicated%20situations%20that%20he%20has%20persisted%20in%20oversimplifying%20or%20whose%20facts%20he%20has%20ignored%20entirely.%20%E2%80%9CShe%20talks%20about%20things%20that%20you%20get%20the%20impression%20he%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20fully%20grasp%2C%E2%80%9D%20one%20of%20the%20senior%20German%20officials%20told%20me.%20Once%2C%20Merkel%20attempted%20to%20explain%20the%20intricate%20politics%20of%20the%20Middle%20East%20to%20Trump.%20%E2%80%9CIt%20seemed%20like%20she%20was%20expecting%20too%20much%20of%20her%20audience%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20official%20concluded.%20Other%20leaders%2C%20such%20as%20Macron%20and%20Shinz%C5%8D%20Abe%2C%20the%20Japanese%20Prime%20Minister%2C%20have%20had%20similar%20experiences%2C%20but%20they%20decided%20to%20play%20to%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20ego%2C%20whether%20with%20military%20pa

Lindsay’s book, “The Empty Throne.” This calculation ignored the fact that the two-per-cent goal isn’t supposed to take effect until 2024, never mind that the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," allies don’t “owe” Trump anything."],["p","Merkel intended to talk about Putin and the threat posed by his dream of Russia’s retaking former Soviet territory. She brought with her a handout prepared for Trump, who she knew disdained lengthy briefing papers. It included a map that showed the borders of the Soviet bloc in 1982, overlaid with Putin’s current territorial ambitions. Trump was unmoved. Merkel later told others that he had interrupted her efforts to discuss Russia in order to boast about his poll ratings among Republican voters."],["p","The President and the Chancellor are almost epically mismatched. Merkel is a trained scientist, who declined a teaching position because she refused to inform on her colleagues. She has a distinctly analytical cast of mind, and she has tried to reason with Trump, or to explain complicated situations that he has persisted in oversimplifying or whose facts he has ignored entirely. “She talks about things that you get the impression he doesn’t fully grasp,” one of the senior German officials told me. Once, Merkel attempted to explain the intricate politics of the Middle East to Trump. “It seemed like she was expecting too much of her audience,” the official concluded. Other leaders, such as Macron and Shinzō Abe, the Japanese Prime Minister, have had similar experiences, but they decided to play to Trump’s ego, whether with military parades or long rounds of golf. Not Merkel. “She doesn’t flatter,” another senior German official told me."],["p","In meetings between Trump and Merkel, the German team came armed with numbers to prove to Trump that he was wrong to call Germany the winner in the U.S.-German trade relationship. The Germans told Trump that, if you take the whole trade balance, it’s actually in America’s favor. Trump “just laughed it off,” one of the German officials told me, leading them to conclude that “it’s very hard to get through to him with fact-based arguments.”"],["p","But this was not merely about getting through to a new President. The problem, it soon became clear, ran deeper than Trump’s habitual dismissal of rational argument or ordinary differences over policy. The President, the German officials concluded, harbored a deep animus toward Germany in general, and Merkel in particular. “There’s a single-mindedness to it and almost an obsession, it seems, and this is something we are hearing from colleagues in the Administration, too: an obsession with Germany,” one of the senior German officials told me. “It seems like it’s very often issues that can seemingly be boiled down to a single number, like two per cent, or to a single concept.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He latches on to that with a certain fixation.” Niels Annen, a Bundestag member who is the German equivalent of the Deputy Secretary of State, told me, “Unfortunately, Germany seems to be very high on the agenda of the President himself.”"],["p","During a recent visit to Berlin, I found that many conversations veered into armchair psychoanalysis of what drives Trump’s relentless focus on Germany and its leader. There was no shortage of theories. Some suggested that Trump dislikes strong women; others speculated that Merkel reminds him of Hillary Clinton. Or perhaps it was all about his father, Fred Trump, who spent the years after the Second World War denying his German heritage and claiming to be Swedish. (Donald Trump repeated the falsehood in “The Art of the Deal.”) Others supposed that Trump saw Merkel not only as an Obama confidant—and therefore toxic—but also as the embodiment of the “globalist,” multilateralist politics that he considers anathema to “America First.”"],["p","Still others posited that Trump’s contempt for Germany and Merkel was fuelled by positive media coverage of Merkel as the new leader of the West. “It’s one more reason to hate her,” one of the German officials told me. But Trump’s treatment of their country as his “punching bag,” as another German diplomat put it, may well have little to do with bad personal chemistry with Merkel. In the ",["em","Playboy"]," interview, Trump inveighed against German cars and complained about “being ripped off so badly by our so-called allies,” themes that he still regularly invokes. “Donald Trump has had it out for Germans for thirty years,” Ivo Daalder, the former U.S. Ambassador to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"],", told me. “When he talks about allies, he means Germany. When he talks about the E.U., he means Germany.”"],["p","Trump’s obsession with Germany has frequently come up in his meetings with other world leaders, and he has questioned Merkel in front of many of Germany’s close European allies. In a session early last year with Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, Trump asked about Merkel’s electoral prospects, and seemed surprised when May predicted that she would win reëlection. After Macron’s meetings with Trump, word invariably filtered back to Berlin that Trump had criticized Merkel."],["p","In an Oval Office meeting last March with Stefan Löfven, the Swedish Prime Minister, Trump launched into a lengthy monologue in which he castigated Germany, according to a senior European diplomat briefed on the meeting, “as he does all the time, irrespective of who is the man or woman.” Trump rambled on to Löfven, then abruptly announced, well before the scheduled time had elapsed, that the meeting was over."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EBy%20the%20spring%20of%202018%2C%20America%E2%80%99s%20European%20allies%20could%20no%20longer%20deny%20the%20scale%20of%20their%20Trump%20problem.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20allies%20spent%20all%20of%202017%20trying%20to%20figure%20out%20how%20they%20could%20entice%20him%20into%20more%20of%20a%20traditional%20relationship%2C%20and%20they%20collectively%20absolutely%20failed%2C%E2%80%9D%20Daalder%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9CBy%202018%2C%20they%20were%20starting%20to%20realize%20this%20was%20the%20real%20Trump.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20March%2C%20Trump%20imposed%20steel%20and%20aluminum%20tariffs%20by%20invoking%20a%20%E2%80%9Cnational%20security%E2%80%9D%20provision%2C%20and%20refused%20to%20exempt%20his%20closest%20allies%20in%20Europe%20and%20Canada%2C%20even%20after%20months%20of%20lobbying.%20Trump%20also%20fired%20two%20of%20the%20three%20officials%20whom%20Europeans%20had%20most%20relied%20on%20for%20stability%20and%20reassurance%2C%20Secretary%20of%20State%20Rex%20Tillerson%20and%20H.%C2%A0R.%20McMaster%2C%20the%20national-security%20adviser%2C%20replacing%20them%20with%20the%20hard-liners%20Mike%20Pompeo%20and%20John%20Bolton.%20The%20one%20remaining%20member%20of%20what%20had%20been%20called%20the%20%E2%80%9Caxis%20of%20adults%2C%E2%80%9D%20Defense%20Secretary%20James%20Mattis%2C%20appeared%20to%20be%20an%20increasingly%20isolated%20establishment%20holdout.%20In%20May%2C%20Trump%20pulled%20out%20of%20the%20Iran%20nuclear%20deal%2C%20despite%20Mattis%E2%80%99s%20opposition%20and%20last-minute%20personal%20visits%20to%20Washington%20by%20both%20Macron%20and%20Merkel.%20%E2%80%9CWith%20friends%20like%20that%2C%20who%20needs%20enemies%3F%E2%80%9D%20Donald%20Tusk%2C%20the%20president%20of%20the%20European%20Council%2C%20tweeted%20after%20the%20decision.%20%E2%80%9CBut%20frankly%20EU%20should%20be%20grateful.%20Thanks%20to%20him%20we%20got%20rid%20of%20all%20illusions.%20We%20realize%20that%20if%20you%20need%20a%20helping%20hand%2C%20you%20will%20find%20one%20at%20the%20end%20of%20your%20arm.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMerkel%2C%20however%2C%20was%20no%20longer%20looking%20like%20the%20leader%20who%20could%20provide%20a%20counterbalance%20to%20Trump.%20She%20barely%20won%20re%C3%ABlection%20in%20the%20fall%20of%202017%2C%20and%20the%20arduous%20work%20of%20assembling%20a%20%E2%80%9CGrand%20Coalition%E2%80%9D%20centrist%20government%20comprising%20her%20Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20and%20the%20fading%20Social%20Democratic%20Party%20dragged%20on%20for%20six%20months.%20The%20far-right%2C%20anti-immigrant%20Alternative%20f%C3%BCr%20Deutschland%20(AfD)%20party%20did%20better%20in%20the%20elections%20than%20any%20such%20party%20since%20the%20end%20of%20the%20Cold%20War.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhile%20Merkel%E2%80%99s%20focus%20turned%20to%20German%20politics%20and%20her%20party%E2%80%99s%20survival%2C%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20attention%20remained%20fixed%20on%20her.%20In%20June%2C%20at%20the%20G-7%20summit%20in%20Canada%2C%20he%20privately%20assailed%20Germany%20and%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ENATO%3C%2Fem%3E%20(%E2%80%9CWhy%20do%20we%20need%20it%3F%E2%80%9D)%20and%20publicly%20demanded%20that%20Russia%2C%20which%20had%20been%20thrown%20out%20of%20the%20group%20after%20the%20annexation%20of%20Crimea%2C%20be%20readmitted.%20When%20leaders%20negotiated%20with%20Trump%20to%20stop%20him%20from%20blocking%20the%20group%E2%80%99s%20traditionally%20unanimous%20communiqu%C3%A9%2C%20Merkel%20took%20the%20lead.%20The%20confrontation%20was%20captured%20in%20a%20photograph%20that%20her%20staff%20posted%20on%20Instagram%3A%20Merkel%20stands%20over%20a%20seated%20Trump%2C%20who%20wears%20a%20scowling%2C%20obstreperous%20expression%20and%20has%20his%20arms%20crossed%20over%20his%20chest.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBolton%2C%20the%20new%20national-security%20adviser%2C%20relished%20the%20fight.%20%E2%80%9CJust%20another%20G7%20where%20other%20countries%20expect%20America%20will%20always%20be%20their%20bank%2C%E2%80%9D%20Bolton%20tweeted%2C%20with%20the%20photograph.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20President%20made%20it%20clear%20today.%20No%20more.%E2%80%9D%20A%20few%20days%20later%2C%20Ian%20Bremmer%2C%20the%20founder%20of%20a%20geopolitical%20advisory%20firm%2C%20reported%20to%20his%20clients%20a%20memorable%20detail%20from%20the%20President%E2%80%99s%20standoff%20with%20Merkel.%20At%20the%20end%20of%20their%20bargaining%20session%2C%20Trump%20threw%20two%20red%20Starburst%20candies%20on%20the%20table%20as%20he%20left.%20%E2%80%9CHere%2C%20Angela%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t%20say%20I%20never%20gave%20you%20anything.%E2%80%9D%20(The%20White%20House%20said%20that%20the%20President%20was%20joking.)%20Hours%20later%2C%20Trump%20reneged%20on%20the%20deal%2C%20tweeting%20from%20Air%20Force%20One%20that%20he%20would%20not%20sign%20the%20communiqu%C3%A9%20after%20all%2C%20saying%20that%20he%20was%20angry%20about%20Justin%20

the spring of 2018, America’s European allies could no longer deny the scale of their Trump problem. “The allies spent all of 2017 trying to figure out how they could entice him into more of a traditional relationship, and they collectively absolutely failed,” Daalder told me. “By 2018, they were starting to realize this was the real Trump.”"],["p","In March, Trump imposed steel and aluminum tariffs by invoking a “national security” provision, and refused to exempt his closest allies in Europe and Canada, even after months of lobbying. Trump also fired two of the three officials whom Europeans had most relied on for stability and reassurance, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and H.&nbsp;R. McMaster, the national-security adviser, replacing them with the hard-liners Mike Pompeo and John Bolton. The one remaining member of what had been called the “axis of adults,” Defense Secretary James Mattis, appeared to be an increasingly isolated establishment holdout. In May, Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, despite Mattis’s opposition and last-minute personal visits to Washington by both Macron and Merkel. “With friends like that, who needs enemies?” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, tweeted after the decision. “But frankly EU should be grateful. Thanks to him we got rid of all illusions. We realize that if you need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of your arm.”"],["p","Merkel, however, was no longer looking like the leader who could provide a counterbalance to Trump. She barely won reëlection in the fall of 2017, and the arduous work of assembling a “Grand Coalition” centrist government comprising her Christian Democratic Union and the fading Social Democratic Party dragged on for six months. The far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party did better in the elections than any such party since the end of the Cold War."],["p","While Merkel’s focus turned to German politics and her party’s survival, Trump’s attention remained fixed on her. In June, at the G-7 summit in Canada, he privately assailed Germany and ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," (“Why do we need it?”) and publicly demanded that Russia, which had been thrown out of the group after the annexation of Crimea, be readmitted. When leaders negotiated with Trump to stop him from blocking the group’s traditionally unanimous communiqué, Merkel took the lead. The confrontation was captured in a photograph that her staff posted on Instagram: Merkel stands over a seated Trump, who wears a scowling, obstreperous expression and has his arms crossed over his chest."],["p","Bolton, the new national-security adviser, relished the fight. “Just another G7 where other countries expect America will always be their bank,” Bolton tweeted, with the photograph. “The President made it clear today. No more.” A few days later, Ian Bremmer, the founder of a geopolitical advisory firm, reported to his clients a memorable detail from the President’s standoff with Merkel. At the end of their bargaining session, Trump threw two red Starburst candies on the table as he left. “Here, Angela,” he said. “Don’t say I never gave you anything.” (The White House said that the President was joking.) Hours later, Trump reneged on the deal, tweeting from Air Force One that he would not sign the communiqué after all, saying that he was angry about Justin Trudeau’s post-summit comments."],["p","Trump was still mad at Merkel, too, and a few days later he launched perhaps his most political attack yet, cheering on her right-wing rivals. “The people in Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up,” Trump tweeted, incorrectly. “Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!”"],["p","By mid-July, at the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," summit in Brussels, the President and the Chancellor were working to maintain a façade of personal civility. (When asked about his repeated attacks on Germany, Trump invariably claims that he has a “very good relationship” with Merkel.) But any pretense of substantive agreement had long since disappeared. Before the summit, “Europe’s broad strategy was: don’t give in, but don’t give up,” Kupchan, Obama’s Europe adviser, told me. “They were attempting to find a balance between pushing back against U.S. policy and standing up to Trump, and at the same time working with the Administration whenever possible, with Merkel as kind of bad cop and Macron good cop.

the realities of Trump and Trumpism have settled at last on European leaders, so, too, has a kind of despair. At a debate that I moderated this summer in Estonia, Constanze Stelzenmüller, a German security analyst, compared Trump’s foreign policy to Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel “The Handmaid’s Tale,” with the Europeans as the handmaids. Norbert Röttgen, the chairman of the Bundestag’s foreign-affairs committee, offered a similarly disturbing metaphor for Trump’s attitude toward Europe. “It’s like your parents questioning their love for you,” he told me, in Berlin, a few days later. “It’s already penetrated the subconscious.”"],["p","Nowhere in Europe is this more true than in Germany, which overcame the shame of Nazism and defeat in the Second World War by embracing a new postwar order designed by American leaders such as Harry Truman, Dean Acheson, and George Marshall. Working collectively through ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"],", the E.U., and other institutions is embedded in modern Germany’s political DNA. “It took Germany the longest of all partners to come to terms with someone like Trump becoming President,” another senior German official told me. “We were very emotional, because our relationship with America is so emotional—it’s more of a son-father relationship—and we didn’t recognize our father anymore and realized he might beat us.”"],["p","The Trump Administration and its Republican defenders dismiss such thinking as a transatlantic version of “Trump derangement syndrome,” an exaggerated response to Trump that often fails to take into account either the Administration’s actual policies or the long history of previous German-American disputes. After all, even Obama pushed Germany to do more on defense spending and countering Russia, and the Trump Administration, if not Trump himself, is confronting bad actors such as Russia and Iran more forcefully and effectively, they argue. “In Germany, there is an immediate emotional hatred for Trump,” a senior Trump Administration official told me. “I always say, you can not like the President, but look at the policies, and the policies have actually been better, better than under Obama, and more successful.”"],["p","In any case, the Administration has chosen not to allay such fears but to exacerbate them. In April, Trump installed Richard Grenell, a conservative Twitter warrior and a former Fox commentator, as his Ambassador to Germany. I happened to be in Berlin in early June, when he alienated his hosts by giving an interview to the alt-right Web site Breitbart. The Breitbart headline said that his role in Germany was to “empower” the European far right’s leaders. (Grenell denied that that was what he meant.) The Ambassador’s undiplomatic language was fit for a “far-right colonial officer,” the German politician Martin Schulz tweeted in response. Grenell has defined his role as “Trump’s man in Europe, not just in Germany,” as Steven Sokol, the president of the American Council on Germany, told me. Steve Bannon praised Grenell in ",["em","The National Interest"]," as “perfect, perfect, perfect.” The senior Trump Administration official told me, of Grenell, “He loves the fight like Trump.

When Merkel announced, in October, that Germany would move forward with the L.N.G. terminal, Grenell and Trump took it as a victory. Another senior Trump Administration official told me, “The U.S. side has raised this issue frequently enough and incessantly enough and insistently enough that Chancellor Merkel heard our concerns.” More brinkmanship, including a threat to impose sanctions on European companies that do work on the pipeline, is possible as Germans weigh whether to finalize Nord Stream 2. “It’s on the table because the President is ready to do it,” the Trump Administration official told me."],["p","Imposing tariffs on European cars—a Trump obsession dating back to the nineteen-eighties—is also still an option, despite a temporary truce called by Trump after he met with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission. No other European country has as substantial a car industry, and so an automobile tariff would be a direct attack on Merkel, a step so dramatic that a real trade war could ensue."],["p","Trump is also proceeding with plans to withdraw from a crucial Reagan-era arms treaty with Russia, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The Obama Administration had first warned that Russia was in violation of the treaty, but Trump’s announcement of a pullout was abrupt and categorical, alienating longtime allies, who felt taken by surprise. Vladimir Putin had already been operating outside the treaty, and now he could make the collapse look like an act of American high-handedness. When, on a Saturday morning in October, Trump told reporters about his decision, Bolton was headed to Moscow, where he was supposed to preview the Administration’s plans. The withdrawal from the I.N.F. treaty is particularly sensitive in Germany, which has renounced nuclear weapons and would be highly vulnerable to the medium-range missiles that Russia could legally deploy after the pact’s collapse. The Administration is likely to proceed regardless, though Trump did accede to Merkel’s request, in their meeting at the G-20 summit earlier this month, to delay the formal announcement and instead give Russia a sixty-day ultimatum endorsed by all the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," allies."],["p","The irony is that, for all of Trump’s bluster and threats, the Trump Administration’s positions on these issues, aside from the Iran nuclear deal, are consistent with his predecessor’s. Obama also pushed for greater European defense spending, set in motion ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NATO"]," troop increases in Eastern Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and objected to Nord Stream 2. Many German leaders oppose the pipeline project, too, and favor more defense spending. Where Trump is different is in how far he is willing to push his allies to accomplish long-standing American priorities, not to mention his public denunciations, abrupt policy shifts, and willingness to insult his allies. This behavior has thoroughly alienated Germans, who are sharply divided on many issues but united in their dislike of Trump and their resistance to just about anything he champions. The Pew Global Attitudes survey this year found that only ten per cent of Germans had a favorable view of Trump. When Trump “tells the German public on television that you owe me, the German public says, ‘We owe this guy? Don’t pay him a dime,’&nbsp;” Wolfgang Ischinger, the former Ambassador, told me. “It makes it harder to agree on anything. It is poisonous for the relationship.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%20June%2C%20less%20than%20a%20week%20after%20Merkel%20confronted%20Trump%20at%20the%20G-7%20meeting%20in%20Canada%2C%20Heiko%20Maas%2C%20the%20new%20German%20Foreign%20Minister%2C%20gave%20a%20rousing%20rejoinder%20to%20Trump.%20Speaking%20to%20young%20leaders%20in%20Berlin%2C%20he%20bemoaned%20the%20%E2%80%9Cgiant%20vacuum%E2%80%9D%20left%20by%20the%20collapse%20of%20American%20leadership.%20Between%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cegoistic%20policy%20of%20%E2%80%98America%20First%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%20and%20threats%20from%20Russia%20and%20China%2C%20Germany%20needed%20to%20lead%20a%20forceful%20European%20response.%20%E2%80%9CThat%20world%20order%20that%20we%20once%20knew%2C%20had%20become%20accustomed%20to%2C%20and%20sometimes%20felt%20comfortable%20in%E2%80%94this%20world%20order%20no%20longer%20exists%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CAlliances%20dating%20back%20decades%20are%20being%20challenged%20in%20the%20time%20it%20takes%20to%20write%20a%20tweet.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIt%20was%20the%20first%20major%20policy%20address%20by%20Maas%2C%20who%20became%20Foreign%20Minister%20when%20Merkel%20put%20together%20her%20new%20coalition%2C%20this%20past%20March%2C%20and%20his%20Social%20Democratic%20Party%20was%20given%20control%20of%20the%20ministry.%20But%20the%20statement%20was%20the%20product%20of%20a%20Trump-inspired%20project%20inside%20the%20German%20Foreign%20Office%20to%20write%20modern%20Germany%E2%80%99s%20first-ever%20%E2%80%9CAmerica%20Strategy.%E2%80%9D%20A%20senior%20German%20official%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CEssentially%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20an%20overhaul%20of%20German%20foreign%20policy%2C%20since%20the%20key%20assumption%20being%20called%20into%20question%20is%20the%20total%20reliance%20we%20have%20on%20the%20friendship%20with%20the%20U.S.%E2%80%9D%20The%20painful%20realization%2C%20he%20added%2C%20was%20that%20%E2%80%9Cwe%20might%20get%20to%20a%20situation%20where%20we%20see%20Americans%20not%20only%20as%20friends%20and%20partners%20but%20also%20as%20competitors%20and%20adversaries.%20We%20don%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20do%20that.%20That%20is%20how%20we%20treat%20other%20great%20powers%20around%20the%20globe%2C%20like%20Russia%20and%20China.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBut%20intense%20debate%20continues%20in%20Berlin%20over%20whether%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20ascendance%20reflects%20a%20genuine%20desire%20on%20the%20part%20of%20the%20U.S.%20to%20withdraw%20from%20the%20world%20or%20is%20an%20aberration%20that%20will%20soon%20be%20rectified%20by%20voters.%20German%20officials%2C%20like%20their%20counterparts%20in%20Washington%20and%20across%20Europe%2C%20disagree%20about%20whether%20Trumpism%20will%20outlive%20Trump%2C%20and%20whether%20Germany%20has%20a%20problem%20with%20a%20man%20or%20with%20a%20country.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMerkel%20has%20been%20more%20cautious%20than%20her%20Foreign%20Minister.%20When%20Maas%20followed%20up%20his%20speech%20with%20a%20strongly%20worded%20op-ed%20in%20the%20newspaper%20%3Cem%3EHandelsblatt%3C%2Fem%3E%20in%20which%20he%20proposed%20that%20Europe%20be%20a%20%E2%80%9Ccounterweight%E2%80%9D%20in%20case%20Trump%20%E2%80%9Ccrosses%20the%20line%2C%E2%80%9D%20Merkel%20rejected%20his%20most%20inflammatory%20proposal%E2%80%94a%20replacement%20for%20the%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ESWIFT%3C%2Fem%3E%20financial-transaction%20system%2C%20independent%20of%20the%20U.S.%2C%20that%20would%20allow%20European%20companies%20to%20keep%20doing%20business%20with%20Iran%2C%20which%20has%20been%20sanctioned%20by%20the%20U.S.%20%E2%80%9CHer%20strategy%20is%20to%20have%20a%20forceful%20defense%2C%E2%80%9D%20Stefan%20Kornelius%2C%20Merkel%E2%80%99s%20biographer%2C%20told%20me.%20Maas%20%E2%80%9Cwants%20to%20go%20on%20offense.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20early%20October%2C%20Maas%20flew%20to%20Washington%20for%20the%20German%20Embassy%E2%80%99s%20annual%20party%20celebrating%20the%20anniversary%20of%20German%20reunification%2C%20in%201990.%20While%20polka%20bands%20played%20and%20guests%20visited%20sausage%20stands%20on%20the%20grounds%20of%20the%20Ambassador%E2%80%99s%20hilltop%20residence%2C%20Maas%20unveiled%20a%20strategy%20of%20a%20different%20sort%3A%20a%20bypass-Trump%2C%20make-nice-to-America%20plan%2C%20supported%20by%20German%20companies.%20The%20program%2C%20called%20Wunderbar%20Together%2C%20envisages%20a%20German%20feel-good%20road%20show%20around%20the%20United%20States%20to%20counteract%20the%20poison%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Washington.%20Barely%20a%20week%20later%2C%20the%20President%20let%20loose%20on%20Germany%20and%20the%20E.U.%20again%2C%20telling%20a%20campaign%20rally%20in%20Council%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20European%20Union%E2%80%94sounds%20so%20nice%2C%20right%3F%20They%20are%20brutal.%C2%A0.%C2%A0.%C2%A0.%20They%20formed%20in%20order%20to%20take%20advantage%20of%20us.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","In June, less than a week after Merkel confronted Trump at the G-7 meeting in Canada, Heiko Maas, the new German Foreign Minister, gave a rousing rejoinder to Trump. Speaking to young leaders in Berlin, he bemoaned the “giant vacuum” left by the collapse of American leadership. Between Trump’s “egoistic policy of ‘America First’&nbsp;” and threats from Russia and China, Germany needed to lead a forceful European response. “That world order that we once knew, had become accustomed to, and sometimes felt comfortable in—this world order no longer exists,” he said. “Alliances dating back decades are being challenged in the time it takes to write a tweet.”"],["p","It was the first major policy address by Maas, who became Foreign Minister when Merkel put together her new coalition, this past March, and his Social Democratic Party was given control of the ministry. But the statement was the product of a Trump-inspired project inside the German Foreign Office to write modern Germany’s first-ever “America Strategy.” A senior German official told me, “Essentially, it’s an overhaul of German foreign policy, since the key assumption being called into question is the total reliance we have on the friendship with the U.S.” The painful realization, he added, was that “we might get to a situation where we see Americans not only as friends and partners but also as competitors and adversaries. We don’t want to do that. That is how we treat other great powers around the globe, like Russia and China.”"],["p","But intense debate continues in Berlin over whether Trump’s ascendance reflects a genuine desire on the part of the U.S. to withdraw from the world or is an aberration that will soon be rectified by voters. German officials, like their counterparts in Washington and across Europe, disagree about whether Trumpism will outlive Trump, and whether Germany has a problem with a man or with a country."],["p","Merkel has been more cautious than her Foreign Minister. When Maas followed up his speech with a strongly worded op-ed in the newspaper ",["em","Handelsblatt"]," in which he proposed that Europe be a “counterweight” in case Trump “crosses the line,” Merkel rejected his most inflammatory proposal—a replacement for the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"SWIFT"]," financial-transaction system, independent of the U.S., that would allow European companies to keep doing business with Iran, which has been sanctioned by the U.S. “Her strategy is to have a forceful defense,” Stefan Kornelius, Merkel’s biographer, told me. Maas “wants to go on offense.”"],["p","In early October, Maas flew to Washington for the German Embassy’s annual party celebrating the anniversary of German reunification, in 1990. While polka bands played and guests visited sausage stands on the grounds of the Ambassador’s hilltop residence, Maas unveiled a strategy of a different sort: a bypass-Trump, make-nice-to-America plan, supported by German companies. The program, called Wunderbar Together, envisages a German feel-good road show around the United States to counteract the poison of Trump’s Washington. Barely a week later, the President let loose on Germany and the E.U. again, telling a campaign rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, “The European Union—sounds so nice, right? They are brutal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

late October, Merkel’s Christian Democrats barely managed to hold on to power in regional elections in Bavaria and Hesse, as the AfD, for the first time, won seats in all of the country’s state parliaments. Facing an internal party coup similar to the one that had brought her to power, Merkel surprised even close advisers with the timing of her announcement, the morning after the elections, that she was stepping down as the party chair and would not seek reëlection as Chancellor when her current term ends, in 2021. The ",["em","Merkel-dämmerung"],", as the German newspapers called it, was finally happening. Trump did not bother to call Merkel about a decision that promised to upend European politics, and an anonymous Trump official celebrated, telling the Washington ",["em","Post"],", “This is a huge win for Trump.”"],["p","The President and his team may have proclaimed victory over Angela Merkel too soon. On December 7th, the Christian Democratic Union selected Merkel’s preferred candidate, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, to be the party’s next leader and thus Merkel’s heir apparent. One of the other two candidates, Jens Spahn, who had been a critic of Merkel’s immigration policy and was friendly with Grenell, Trump’s Ambassador to Germany, recently met with Bolton in the White House, a move unusual enough for a German Minister of Health that it was covered in the German media. In the end, Spahn received only a hundred and fifty-seven votes out of the nine hundred and ninety-nine cast. Trumpism is not ascendant in Merkel’s party, at least not yet. “Thanks, boss,” read the placards that greeted Merkel when she gave a valedictory address, fighting back tears."],["p","On November 6th, Trump suffered his own political setback, losing control of the House of Representatives to the Democrats in the midterm elections. Nevertheless, the President and his Administration have shown every sign of escalating the fight with Europe. “We really do need Germany to do more than it has since the end of the Cold War,” one of the senior Trump Administration officials told me in early December. A few days later, Secretary of State Pompeo gave his bellicose speech in Brussels, the heart of European multilateralism, attacking the E.U. and an array of other international organizations. They “must be reformed or eliminated,” he warned."],["p","Such threats from Washington are no longer dismissed in Europe as empty words. America’s closest allies are seriously considering policies that would have been unlikely in the pre-Trump era. On the day of the U.S. midterms, Emmanuel Macron proposed the creation of a new pan-European army to achieve “a Europe that can defend itself on its own, without relying only on the United States.” The move angered Trump Administration officials, who saw it as “particularly poor form” by Macron, as one official put it, and “disingenuous on the part of the Europeans,” given that “we’re responsible for European security that many of our European allies will not pay for themselves.” A week later, Merkel gave a speech to the European Parliament endorsing Macron’s proposal, no matter how unrealistic it seems. The Chancellor’s legendary patience finally seemed to have worn thin. “The days where we can unconditionally rely on others are gone,” she said."],["p","But, no matter how sharp Merkel’s words have become, the idea that she can be Trump’s rival or his sparring partner is not realistic, either. She has no military to counter Putin, no nuclear weapons, and no public support for spending the money required for those things. Europe—with Brexit travails and French protests and angry populists—is still unravelling. “There was this mythology, as if Merkel could save us from ourselves. She would save the European project. She would save the rules-based order. She would save us from Trump,” Julianne Smith, a former senior Pentagon official who is now living in Berlin, said. “There’s just no prospect of that.” Angela Merkel is not the leader of the free world, nor will she be.&nbsp;♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5911121fdf652b705f4ab2a0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5911121fdf652b705f4ab2a0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Diplomacy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-diplomacy"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Annals of Diplomacy","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"annals-of-diplomacy"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Susan B.

This account of the author’s struggle with epileptic seizures as a young man merges elements of medical drama, anti-discrimination fable, and coming-of-age memoir. Eichenwald, an investigative journalist, uses official records, letters, diaries, and interviews with friends and family to reconstruct events beginning forty years ago. The result is both poignant and infuriating: a cavalcade of desperate loved ones, inept doctors, and college administrators who try to kick him out because of his seizures. Most vivid are the descriptions of near-fatal injuries and emotional ravages he sustained. Of awakening from a seizure, Eichenwald writes, “It was as if I had fallen from the sky, with no memory of where I had been or how I had returned.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5c104bf3c6b2757bf40d129d%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c104bf3c6b2757bf40d129d%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c104bf3c6b2757bf40d129d%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c104bf3c6b2757bf40d129d%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c104bf3c6b2757bf40d129d%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c104bf3c6b2757bf40d129d%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5c104bf3c6b2757bf40d129d%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c104bf3c6b2757bf40d129d"}]]],["p",["strong",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Writer-Our-Time-Life-Berger/dp/1786637421"},"A Writer of Our Time"]],["em",", by Joshua Sperling (Verso)"],". The British writer and art critic John Berger, who died in 2017, is the subject of this dense but engaging intellectual biography. Tracing Berger’s creative evolution, the book analyzes highlights from his vast output—the influential 1972 BBC series “Ways of Seeing,” which he never considered a major work; the Booker Prize-winning novel “G.” (and his denunciation of the prize); stories inspired by the French peasants among whom he lived for decades—and situates them within his empathetic Marxism. And though, for Berger, “the defeat of political ideals was a kind of personal genesis,” Sperling notes, “he certainly never let go of his politics, which remained, until his death, a powerful source of self-belief.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5c104c04c5aa777fdb411e63%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c104c04c5aa777fdb411e63%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c104c04c5aa777fdb411e63%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c104c04c5aa777fdb411e63%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c104c04c5aa777fdb411e63%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c104c04c5aa777fdb411e63%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5c104c04c5aa777fdb411e63%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c104c04c5aa777fdb411e63"}]]],["p",["strong",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Split-Tooth-Tanya-Tagaq/dp/0670070092"},"Split Tooth"]],["em",", by Tanya Tagaq (Viking)"],". This mystical novel draws on the author’s life to tell the story of a young girl growing up in Nunavut in the nineteen-seventies, in an Inuit community that has experienced “government relocation, the shift into capitalism, and the moulting of the Shaman Skin.” Her days are spent in fear—hiding from gatherings that turn drunken and violent, warding off bullies, suffering sexual abuse, and finding dangerous or mind-altering ways to distract herself from it all. In a magic-realist turn, she is raped one night by the northern lights and gives birth to twins—one benevolent, one malign.

To honor a friend’s last wish, the protagonist of this novel, a veteran journalist named Yuuki, sets out to scale a formidable rock face in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, where, seventeen years earlier, a plane crash killed more than five hundred people. In Yuuki’s newsroom, the disaster sets a sense of mission and ambitions for a career-making scoop in conflict with old grudges and departmental feuds. Yokoyama moves his vivid characters through an adrenaline-filled, if somewhat male-dominated, narrative, offset by Yuuki’s more meditative reëxamination of his life, as he ruminates on public tragedy and private pain, haunted by the words of his friend: “I climb up to step down.”"]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5907ef77019dfc3494e9c911","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"books-tag"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[],"dek":"","formatting":{},"hed":"Briefly

a recent morning, Elizabeth Chan, America’s most successful, and perhaps only, full-time Christmas-song singer-slash-composer, was waiting in a dingy back corridor of Macy’s to meet Santa. Ahead of her in line, children whined and shopping bags rustled. A tinny karaoke version of “Deck the Halls” piped through the department-store speakers. Chan groaned. “It’s really generic,” she said, of the song."],["p","But Santa was Santa, and Chan thought it would be nice for her eighteen-month-old-daughter, Noelle, to meet him. “Everybody has the luxury of dealing with Santa for only a month,” Chan said. She wore a black knit cap and a burgundy coat, and pushed Noelle in a stroller. But, she said, in her household it’s “a year-round issue.”"],["p","In 2012, Chan quit her job as an executive at Condé Nast to pursue her dream of creating “a great Christmas standard”—a song like “White Christmas”—that would be sung year after year for generations. There were obstacles: though Chan had a good voice, she wasn’t a professional songwriter. She and her husband, a designer, would have to go into their savings. But she was determined. “Christmas music has a magical ability to transport you to your childhood or happier times,” Chan said. “At least, for me it does.” Growing up in Battery Park City, in a family of Chinese and Filipino immigrants, she loved the traditions: “Writing a letter to Santa, being good.” Each year on Christmas Eve, the family would gather at her uncle’s house, in New Jersey."],["p","For nearly two years, Chan wrote a Christmas song a day. She recorded fifty, paying for studio time and musicians. She sent demos to music producers and to Kelly Clarkson’s then record label. No dice. Her savings dwindled, along with her family’s patience. “They were, like, ‘What are you doing?’&nbsp;” Chan recalled. “&nbsp;‘Go get a real job.’&nbsp;”"],["p","When Chan was on the verge of giving up, a colleague suggested that she put out the songs herself. A ten-thousand-dollar Kickstarter campaign later, she released an album called “Everyday Holidays.” The single “Fa La La” landed on the 2013 ",["em","Billboard"]," chart, right between two songs by Clarkson. Chan has now released seven albums and had four ",["em","Billboard"]," hits, including this year’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Gift-Ever-Elizabeth-Chan/dp/B07HFKDCNM"},"Best Gift Ever"],",” a song she wrote for her husband which reached the Top Ten earlier this month."],["p","Brian Demay, the corporate program director for Cumulus Media, said that Chan is the only full-time Christmas singer-songwriter he knows of, and that he plays her music regularly on WRRM, in Cincinnati. “My parents raised me on Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, and the Harry Simeone Chorale,” he said. “I would count Elizabeth among those.”"],["p","At Macy’s, the line shuffled past some abandoned shelving units. Noelle fidgeted. “This is the least Christmassy thing I’ve done this year,” Chan said, peering behind a door to a staff locker room. “Don’t open it—you’ll find a couple of unhappy elves on their smoke break.” She talked about her songwriting process. Every year, from January to August, she churns out between fifty and a hundred Christmas songs, recording only the ones whose melodies she can still remember months later. They span multiple genres, from “Christmas in the City,” an earnest ballad, to “Vixen,” a naughty-girl pop number inspired by the reindeer name. (Sample lyric: “Don’t get mad ’cause you can’t play these reindeer games.”) “It’s totally eclectic, and that’s what makes it fun for me,” she said."],["p","Mariah Carey’s ",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Merry-Christmas-Mariah-Carey/dp/B000002A46/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_15_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=YDSB5WH9NKQH5KN95721"},"1994 hit"]," “All I Want for Christmas Is You” played in Macy’s. Chan is ambivalent about the song, which Carey crafted “to sound like it was from, like, the nineteen-fifties,” she said. “A lot of artists try to replicate what they think Christmas ",["em","should"]," sound like.” Chan prefers to focus on her own life. “The Ghost of Christmas Past” is about missing her grandmother. (“The years go by so fast&nbsp;/&nbsp;I thought that it would last.”) Recently, she’s been rediscovering the holiday through her daughter’s eyes. “She’s my enzyme,” Chan said, and asked Noelle, “Can you say ‘enzyme’?”"],["p","The line moved again. “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer”: Yay or nay? “Yay,” Chan said. “But I know it’s very controversial now. People are saying that it’s a song about bullying.”"],["p","After an hour, Chan and Noelle entered Santaland at last. An elf waved from a candy-cane visitor’s kiosk. Toy bears and ducks frolicked in winter scenes. A train display whirred below a twinkling night sky. Noelle beamed."],["p","Tchaikovsky’s “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” was playing. Chan approved.

had just come to her new sort-of home in a town called Rhinehorn. She had driven five hours from her former home in Duchess County and arrived with stunned, hunted relief. She had come to Rhinehorn for a six-month job as an admin assistant in the dean of students’ office at a private college. The job had come through a Facebook friend, an acquaintance from high school, who was also friends with the admin assistant for whom Carol was standing in; thanks to their vague connection, this total stranger had wrangled furnished accommodations for Carol on the ground that she was recently divorced and “struggling.” Technically, Carol was not divorced, but, yes, she was struggling, and so, except for what she could fit in her car, she had put all her stuff (the stuff from the house she’d shared with her husband, Lloyd) in a cheap storage unit on a concrete lot. She had broken up with Lloyd six months before accepting the job in Rhinehorn. The night before driving to Rhinehorn, she’d also broken up with a “boyfriend” she’d been seeing; more exactly, she’d run out of their motel room after he’d become enraged at her for singing “Ain’t Talkin’ ’Bout Love” in the shower and accused her of wanting to sodomize him."],["p","Because a popular and picaresque county fair was in progress, all the hotels were booked and she’d had to sleep in her car, which she could at least park on a quiet street. She was woken at dawn by a high, excited voice calling, “Come on! Come on, you little weirdo!” The voice was ecstatic with love, and Carol sat up heart first; a lady in a pink bathrobe on the front steps of her porch beckoned to a young dog that was wagging its tail at the edge of the woman’s yard. It was a neighborhood where Carol and her husband used to take walks, and, though she knew this yard by sight, the red flowers, the decorative stone animals, and the twirling little ornament in the shape of a star looked eerie and foreign in the dawn light. She had not seen the robed woman before or the dog, which ran at her, barking, when she started the car."],["p","She got breakfast by herself at a diner, and thought about going by the motel to say goodbye to the “boyfriend.” Instead, she picked up her cat at the vet (she had boarded the animal overnight) and drove to her new home: a sunny two-room annex attached to a red Dutch Colonial on a residential street without a sidewalk. The furniture (saggy couch, weird end tables, mismatched dining set) looked as though it had come from a Salvation Army showroom display, and, as she learned later, it had. Her bedroom looked out on a lot overgrown with wildflowers; her sitting room faced the neighbors’ yard, which had strong, confident grass and a hammock full of children’s toys. Carol’s yard was mostly weeds, but there was on its periphery a beautiful tree with spreading, somehow joyous branches; she looked out on it and felt dim, seeping gratitude for its beauty."],["p","Carol was fifty-seven but she did not feel that old. She did not feel any age. She might have liked that ambiguity. But instead it was frightening, as if she had found herself on the wrong side of what had suddenly been revealed as the iron law of the world. This feeling was made worse by the realization that no one occupied the Dutch Colonial she was annexed to; being attached to an empty house felt like being attached to the ghost of her marriage, unable to live in it or to get away from it. On her third night in Rhinehorn, she went out at dusk and, not even caring if anyone saw her, pressed her face against the windows of the empty house and peered in. The place was not only much bigger than hers, the furniture in it was nicer than what she had. It was generic and bland, but at least it all matched and the couch probably didn’t sag when sat on."],["p","She looked on the bright side. Her rent was next to nothing, which meant that she could pay down the ruinous debt she had accrued by trying to support Lloyd’s life-coach business as it had gone bust. The bed was comfortable, the TV was huge, the cat loved the yard, and Carol enjoyed watching the little creature timidly patrol its border. The job was O.K. (routing students through the correct channels, making keys, paperwork, constant screen time); it was essentially work that she could forget as soon as she returned to her temporary home in the evening. Although Carol had a master’s degree in English and had once wanted to teach, she had long ago accepted this kind of work and was good at it."],["p","There was peace in this: she watched the news while exercising with a hula hoop for twenty minutes, ate, played with the cat, then walked around the neighborhood feeling her body shifting tectonically under her brain. Despite her age, she was still bleeding almost monthly, and this anomaly was a strain on the organization of her self. The sky of her psyche had gone Technicolor with hormonal discharge; it was full of huge, luridly burning stars. The most pacific grasses and meadows of her inner being were subject to sudden sinkholes full of bone and bilious tissue, spilling over with the multifarious faces, the intimate crimes and errors of her life, all pulling her in the opposite direction as she walked forward, saying hi to people and their dogs, mostly middle-aged except for one bent but fast-moving old lady with an alert husky. She passed yards where children played while adults dug around in border gardens or sat on porches exuding hard-won security. She never spoke to them and they did not speak to her—until the smiling husband across the street from her paused while weeding his powerful grass, rose out of his squat, and invited her to come for dinner sometime. She glanced at the house; it was white with red shutters and there was a clay relief of a flying bird hung next to the door. She said, “That would be nice.” Her neighbor introduced himself as Duane; he said that his wife, Dana, was in H.R. and was friends with the woman Carol had replaced. “She’s on maternity leave,” he needlessly explained. “She’s with her husband, who’s sixty miles away. They work in separate towns most of the time.” “Oh,” Carol said. “That sounds tough.” “It is,” he said. “I think somebody’s going to have to change jobs.” His two little girls swung crazily in the hammock, kicking at each other and crying, “Who ",["em","who!"],"&nbsp;” Or something like it."],["p","She went back home, drank wine from a juice glass, looked at TV, answered e-mails, watched animal videos and horrible accident/crime videos, some porn. Strictly speaking, she didn’t watch porn, but she had got interested in a magazine think piece about torture porn. The cover image was striking and even artistic, and the article described a particular film that had been made by a former prostitute about her experience of being tortured by a psychotic john; she said that making the film and performing in it had been a healing experience. Carol could not resist: she looked up the trailer for the film online and saw that, yes, it was about torture. The woman was shaved, beaten, starved, made to wear a leather mask, and then taken to the desert, where she was forced to run until she collapsed. Carol described it to her younger friend Meg on the phone. “Do you believe that?” Meg said. “Do you believe she really made the movie because it would be ",["em","healing"],"?” “No,” Carol said. “Well, I don’t know. Maybe. Maybe it was healing for her.” They talked about Meg’s fiancé for a while, then Carol got ready for bed, loved up the cat, and had low-key sex thoughts about the guy she’d run away from the night before coming to Rhinehorn. Her mind eased into sleep, calmly sorting images of what she’d done that day—then woke with a jerk, as though she’d hit the brake on a car driving in deep mud, wildly swerving. She concentrated on the cat’s little body next to her and thought, ",["em","Steady"],". Then she was in the jaws of a shark, screaming and fighting as it yanked her back and forth, down into churning water.

people at the dean’s office were extremely thoughtful and (because they assumed her husband had ditched her?) almost too nice. One of them was at least able to tell her something about the Dutch Colonial: it was normally used for a visiting-professor position but this year the invited visitor had cancelled at the last minute and the backup couldn’t come until January. “I didn’t even know there was an outbuilding,” the woman said. “I mean an annex. I wonder what they put that on for?”"],["p","Eventually, Carol had dinner with Dana and Duane, the people across the street. Their home was well kept but bloomed in the corners with complex personal detritus, kindhearted art and a raucous heap of toys extruding stuffed-animal legs and the heads of dolls with food-coloring hair. Music played from a laptop—a soft and shining voice sang “Someone to Watch Over Me.” The younger girl, Ada, waltzed to the sound of it while the older one, Estella, sighed with impatience at its silky slowness. Carol handed Dana the caponata dish she’d brought, an eggplant salad with four tablespoons of brown sugar even though the recipe called for two—because who could expect kids to eat eggplant otherwise? “Oh, it looks great,” Dana said and put it on the table along with the beef-rib dinner she’d made after, probably, a full day of H.R. Duane, who taught junior high, beamed and bantered with the children about their projects until Estella snapped, “Oh, Dad, stop pretending that everything about us is so great,” embarrassing him into silence."],["p","They prayed before eating, asking God to remind them to always help those who had less than they. Carol wondered for an affronted moment if maybe they meant her. Then she thought, Well, it’s O.K., I do have less than them, and tucked in. Dana was a great cook and an unusual conversationalist, though afterward Carol could not remember anything they had talked about, except (dimly) the reasons that fracking was not entirely a bad idea and the mysterious existence of certain early mammals, the funny shapes of which Ada’s first-grade class had made into cookies. Instead, she remembered the warm feeling of life in the house, the layers of it. She remembered Dana’s white, loose-fitting face with its frame of nondescript brown hair indicating the plain female of the species: no vanity, nothing meant to allure. Practical intelligence, nimble strength, and deep animal will were her traits. Duane, in comparison, seemed human and heady but pliant, wanting to please and be pleased; he had been visibly hurt when his eight-year-old daughter had snapped at him, and it had not occurred to him to snap back. Dana had not seemed to notice, but Ada had; her face went grave at the insult and she lowered her eyes. She seemed the happier of the girls, shiny-eyed, vibrant, and sun-brown, with deeply colored lips. Estella was paler and more recessive, already critical and disappointed. But she was a nice kid. She didn’t want to eat the caponata, but when she tasted how sweet it was she gave Carol a look of pleasure that landed very gently."],["p","It was a nice evening that somehow had the effect of making Carol feel shy about seeing her neighbors again. Instead of walking in the evenings, she began to drive around the country surrounding Rhinehorn. This place was mysterious to her; there was a character to it that felt just outside her range of experience. The road into the farmland was a county road, sparsely lined with economically mismatched houses—beat-up boxes with meagre strips of yard were situated next to charming farmhouses set back amid leafy trees. Carol was mesmerized by the mixture of colors and textures flashing past: grasses, stone fences, an old wooden house stripped of paint, a bush unselfishly extending its bright-pink flowers against the wall of a dull-green house, making the drab color into a gorgeous celadon. There was a family she saw often outside a dirty-looking white house, hanging laundry, lounging on a torn, filthy couch, and, once, cooking on a tiny grill on their patch of lawn, standing and eating off paper plates, no table, just a Styrofoam cooler of canned drinks. She glimpsed a plump girl in shorts, fiercely chewing, and a shirtless man with a fat back, crouched at the grill, his body radiant with generosity as he handed somebody a plate of meat. Carol passed them going fifty-five but still they affected her, like some submerged memory, a torn photo of a forgotten family stuck randomly in an old album. Then came billboards offering debt resolution, gym memberships, and help for feminine incontinence, and one for something called “The Acceptance Journey” that depicted large, benign-looking people of color hugging one another. She thought, It must be something to do with church, that last one."],["p","Back in the annex she would turn on the TV and drink while watching non-stop news rehashing situations she had already heard about. She changed the channel at ten-minute commercial intervals to watch shows about terrible crimes. It was a mashup of mayhem, real and imagined: old people buried alive by their friends’ kids who had cleaned out their bank accounts; a woman held captive and raped in a storage locker for months; a bullied office worker avenging himself violently; a scrawny teen-ager trying to defend Islam by blowing up a school. Sometimes Carol watched, drank, and cried; sometimes she texted somebody from her old life and described how boring it was in Rhinehorn. Once, she passed out crying and woke at two in the morning with her face numb against the disgusting carpet, her phone clutched in one hand and the worried cat pawing her ear."],["p","Where would she go after this?

was late November when she came home and saw an envelope sitting in the crotch of the tree in her yard. She thought, Someone has written to me! She reached for it eagerly and turned it over to read the address. It said, “To the Grinch.” She opened the envelope and read, “Dear Grinch: How are you? We are good. Are you getting ready for Christmas? Are you at the Whos’ already? Here is what I would like: silk slippers from Target (pink and silver), a ceramic cat and kittens, a beauty kit in a vinyl case, it could be leopard or zebra if they have it. I know it’s early, but I want to give you plenty of time! Love, Estella.”"],["p","She e-mailed Dana and discovered that, according to family lore, the Grinch used the tree in Carol’s yard as a mail-delivery system; Dana had meant to get the letter in the morning but had been late for work. Carol said she would bring the letter to Dana the next day, then surfed some animal videos. But she was thinking of the heap of toys across the street, the winking corners, the music; the family seemed to her like pink flowers against a dull background. She e-mailed Dana again and said, “Would it be O.K. if I wrote back to Estella? As the Grinch? It could be fun!” And almost right away Dana answered yes. Excited, Carol got a notebook of lined paper and wrote her message in a crude, Grinchy hand: “Hey Estella, this is the Grinch. I was staying with the Whos but we had a big fight so I left. I’m back to hating Christmas again, and I’m spending it in the cave with my Winged Servants. But even though I hate Christmas I still like you, and I’ll see about that list! Your friend, the Grinch.” She tore it roughly from the binder—she thought this was what a Grinch would do—and put it in a plain envelope addressed to Estella, which she then placed in the tree."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c115dff17c5b74ef07ee7f5%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c115dff17c5b74ef07ee7f5%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c115dff17c5b74ef07ee7f5%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c115dff17c5b74ef07ee7f5"}]],["p","The next day, she took a different turn off the county road and found herself in a less populated place. This road was mostly pastures and fields of crops, tucked in and fallow for the winter. The few houses were set back so far off the road that she almost didn’t see them. The sun had just gone down, and white light glowed between the darkening sky and the dormant fields, the crouching, saturnine orchards. Hers was the only car on the road then and she was surprised to see, on such an untravelled byway, another billboard advertising “The Acceptance Journey.” It, too, depicted pairs of large, benign people of color, men and women looking joyfully at her with their arms around each other. Carol felt a rush of emotion, the strong desire to go wherever these people were, to accept and to be accepted. She wondered if a white person would be allowed in; not long ago, a white man had gone to a black church claiming that he wanted to pray and had murdered people instead. But was the billboard advertising a church?"],["p","When she got home, Carol surreptitiously checked the tree and was sorry to find no envelope. The next day, there was no envelope, or the day after that. Carol quit driving and began walking again, hoping to run into her neighbors. She did see them; they smiled and waved. Ten days passed and still there was no envelope. Finally, Carol approached Dana from the street and asked if Estella had got the letter. “I read it over her shoulder,” Dana said. “She didn’t say anything, but she got very stony. Then she went upstairs. Duane asked her about it at dinner, but she said that it was personal and she didn’t want to talk about it.”"],["p","Carol began apologizing, but Dana said, “Don’t worry about it—she might still write back to you. I’m curious what she’ll say.”"],["p","Carol went back to the annex, poured some wine, and called her sister Grace, in New Jersey. She told her the story and concluded, “What kind of snowflake is this kid? It’s a Grinch, what does she expect?” She meant to be funny, but her sister didn’t laugh. She went on, “I mean, you gotta let a Grinch be a Grinch!” Her sister said, “I’m surprised the girl’s mother would let you write to her like that. I mean, she doesn’t know you; you could’ve said anything.”"],["p","“I guess she thinks I’m a nice person,” Carol said."],["p","“Oh, I’m sure she does. I mean, you are a nice person! But still. If it were me—”"],["p","Carol gritted her teeth. Her sister had stopped working because her son had Asperger’s and she didn’t trust anyone to babysit him; it wasn’t just that anyone could be a molester—although anyone could, even girls could—it was that more subtle damage could be inflicted by incautious words, hurtful facial expressions, an insensitive lack of attention at the wrong moment. Grace’s husband owned a coffee company that had made him rich, so leaving her job might have been a reasonable choice—except that then the marriage had broken up and Grace had found herself a single mother with next to no job skills, at the age of fifty-three."],["p","“You don’t know what’s happening in the little girl’s life,” Grace said. “She could be especially sensitive to any kind of rupture.”"],["p","“I don’t know why. Her parents are the most stable people in the world.”"],["p","“How well do you know them?”"],["p","It was Grace who had ended the marriage. Her husband had never got over his disappointment at having an autistic son, however high-functioning, and his unkindness to the boy had caused such a rift that for the past five years the couple had slept on different floors of their house. Grace’s therapist had urged her to separate for the sake of her son and for her own self-esteem. Grace’s hairdresser had urged her to wait it out: “I believe there’s still love there, but even if there isn’t you have to take the long view—eventually he’ll die and you and Jonny will have that big house.”"],["p","Carol wasn’t sure who was right, the therapist or the hairdresser, and lately neither was Grace. But, listening to Grace describe her online-dating experiences, Carol was thinking hairdresser."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EAfter%20she%20hung%20up%2C%20she%20decided%20to%20write%20another%20letter.%20This%20time%20she%20chose%20to%20write%20on%20unlined%20printer%20paper%2C%20which%20seemed%20a%20little%20nicer.%20She%20wrote%2C%20%E2%80%9CDear%20Estella%3A%20I%20am%20one%20of%20the%20Grinch%E2%80%99s%20Winged%20Assistants%20and%20I%20am%20writing%20to%20you%20because%20the%20Grinch%20is%20too%20embarrassed%20to%20write%20himself.%20He%20is%20very%20upset%20because%20you%20didn%E2%80%99t%20answer%20his%20letter%20and%20he%20thinks%20you%20are%20angry%20at%20him%20about%20the%20Whos.%20Just%20between%20you%20and%20me%2C%20Estella%2C%20he%E2%80%99s%20angry%20at%20himself.%20He%20knows%20the%20fight%20with%20the%20Whos%20was%20his%20fault%20but%20he%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20know%20how%20to%20apologize.%20I%20know%20he%20cares%20a%20great%20deal%20about%20what%20you%20think%2C%20and%20I%E2%80%99m%20wondering%20if%20maybe%20you%20could%20write%20to%20him%20and%20give%20him%20some%20advice.%20I%20think%20it%20would%20make%20a%20big%20difference!%20But%20please%20don%E2%80%99t%20mention%20that%20I%20asked%20you!%20Secretly%20Yours%2C%20Winged%20Assistant%20002.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBecause%20it%20had%20been%20two%20weeks%20since%20the%20last%20letter%2C%20Carol%20decided%20to%20distress%20this%20one%20so%20that%20Estella%20would%20think%20the%20Winged%20Assistant%20had%20written%20sooner.%20She%20sprinkled%20it%20lightly%20with%20water%2C%20then%20took%20it%20out%20to%20the%20yard%2C%20where%20she%20rubbed%20it%20with%20dirt%2C%20walked%20on%20it%2C%20then%20buried%20it%20under%20a%20pile%20of%20leaves%20with%20a%20rock%20on%20top.%20She%20let%20it%20sit%20there%20for%20a%20day%2C%20then%20took%20it%20back%20into%20the%20house%20and%20let%20it%20dry%20on%20the%20heater%3B%20in%20the%20interim%2C%20she%20e-mailed%20Dana%20and%2C%20when%20she%20got%20the%20O.K.%2C%20she%20went%20across%20the%20street%20and%20knocked%20on%20the%20door.%20Dana%20let%20her%20in%20with%20a%20subtle%20dramatic%20flair%3B%20Carol%20spoke%20in%20a%20tone%20of%20bewilderment%20tinged%20with%20wonder.%20%E2%80%9CEstella%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20%E2%80%9CI%20found%20a%20letter%20in%20my%20yard%20that%20seems%20to%20be%20for%20you.%20It%E2%80%99s%20from%20someone%20calling%20himself%20a%20Winged%20Assistant.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CI%20know%20who%20that%20is!%E2%80%9D%20the%20child%20said%2C%20jumping%20up%20from%20the%20sofa.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20next%20evening%2C%20there%20was%20a%20letter%20lying%20in%20the%20lap%20of%20the%20tree.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CDear%20Winged%20Assistant%3A%20I%E2%80%99m%20sure%20that%20if%20the%20Grinch%20apologized%20the%20Whos%20would%20accept%20right%20away%2C%20they%20are%20so%20nice!%20But%20I%20can%20write%20to%20the%20Grinch.%20If%20you%20tell%20me%20what%20the%20fight%20was%20about%2C%20it%20would%20help%20me%20give%20advice.%20Love%2C%20Estella.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ECarol%20drank%2C%20watched%20TV%2C%20and%20thought%20about%20what%20to%20write%20back.%20For%20some%20reason%2C%20she%20thought%20of%20the%20couples%20counsellor%20she%20and%20her%20husband%20had%20seen%2C%20a%20woman%20named%20Mitzi%2C%20with%20long%2C%20powerful%20arms%20and%20a%20glass%20eye.%20Mitzi%20had%20seen%20each%20of%20them%20alone%20first%2C%20and%20then%20the%20two%20of%20them%20together.%20When%20Carol%20came%20by%20herself%2C%20Mitzi%20had%20asked%20her%20why%20she%20wanted%20to%20break%20up%20with%20her%20husband.%20Carol%20had%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t.%20I%20just%20want%20to%20have%20sex%20with%20other%20people.%E2%80%9D%20Mitzi%20had%20a%20chest%20of%20toys%20in%20her%20office%20and%20she%E2%80%99d%20asked%20Carol%20to%20choose%20a%20toy%20that%20best%20represented%20the%20part%20of%20her%20that%20wanted%20so%20badly%20to%20have%20sex%20with%20other%20people%20that%20she%20was%20willing%20to%20jeopardize%20her%20marriage.%20Carol%20chose%20a%20troll%20doll%20with%20pink%20hair%20and%20a%20rhinestone%20navel.%20%E2%80%9CSo%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mitzi%20had%20said%20to%20the%20doll.%20%E2%80%9CWho%20are%20you%3F%E2%80%9D%20Carol%20had%20felt%20a%20perverse%2C%20exultant%20glow%20sneak%20over%20her%20face.%20She%E2%80%99d%20smiled%20and%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CMy%20name%20is%20Legion.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOn%20her%20favorite%20show%2C%20the%20F.B.I.%20was%20closing%20in%20on%20a%20serial%20killer%20who%20disembowelled%20women%20and%20made%20them%20scrub%20their%20own%20guts%20off%20the%20floor%20until%20they%20died.%20As%20always%2C%20the%20heroes%20had%20figured%20out%20who%20the%20killer%20was%20through%20computer-based%20psychological%20analysis.%20They%20had%20scientifically%20deduced%20that%20his%20mother%20had%20been%20a%20maid%20who%20had%20dropped%20dead%20while%20working%20for%20a%20sadistic%20rich%20woman.%20This%20show%20nearly%20always%20ended%20with%20F.B.I.%20agents%20bursti

she hung up, she decided to write another letter. This time she chose to write on unlined printer paper, which seemed a little nicer. She wrote, “Dear Estella: I am one of the Grinch’s Winged Assistants and I am writing to you because the Grinch is too embarrassed to write himself. He is very upset because you didn’t answer his letter and he thinks you are angry at him about the Whos. Just between you and me, Estella, he’s angry at himself. He knows the fight with the Whos was his fault but he doesn’t know how to apologize. I know he cares a great deal about what you think, and I’m wondering if maybe you could write to him and give him some advice. I think it would make a big difference! But please don’t mention that I asked you! Secretly Yours, Winged Assistant 002.”"],["p","Because it had been two weeks since the last letter, Carol decided to distress this one so that Estella would think the Winged Assistant had written sooner. She sprinkled it lightly with water, then took it out to the yard, where she rubbed it with dirt, walked on it, then buried it under a pile of leaves with a rock on top. She let it sit there for a day, then took it back into the house and let it dry on the heater; in the interim, she e-mailed Dana and, when she got the O.K., she went across the street and knocked on the door. Dana let her in with a subtle dramatic flair; Carol spoke in a tone of bewilderment tinged with wonder. “Estella,” she said. “I found a letter in my yard that seems to be for you. It’s from someone calling himself a Winged Assistant.”"],["p","“I know who that is!” the child said, jumping up from the sofa."],["p","The next evening, there was a letter lying in the lap of the tree."],["p","“Dear Winged Assistant: I’m sure that if the Grinch apologized the Whos would accept right away, they are so nice! But I can write to the Grinch. If you tell me what the fight was about, it would help me give advice. Love, Estella.”"],["p","Carol drank, watched TV, and thought about what to write back. For some reason, she thought of the couples counsellor she and her husband had seen, a woman named Mitzi, with long, powerful arms and a glass eye. Mitzi had seen each of them alone first, and then the two of them together. When Carol came by herself, Mitzi had asked her why she wanted to break up with her husband. Carol had said, “I don’t. I just want to have sex with other people.” Mitzi had a chest of toys in her office and she’d asked Carol to choose a toy that best represented the part of her that wanted so badly to have sex with other people that she was willing to jeopardize her marriage. Carol chose a troll doll with pink hair and a rhinestone navel. “So,” Mitzi had said to the doll. “Who are you?” Carol had felt a perverse, exultant glow sneak over her face. She’d smiled and said, “My name is Legion.”"],["p","On her favorite show, the F.B.I. was closing in on a serial killer who disembowelled women and made them scrub their own guts off the floor until they died. As always, the heroes had figured out who the killer was through computer-based psychological analysis. They had scientifically deduced that his mother had been a maid who had dropped dead while working for a sadistic rich woman. This show nearly always ended with F.B.I. agents bursting in on the villain in the midst of his last crime and shouting, “Drop the gun! We know what you’re going through!” Which seemed a tall order in this case."],["p","She wrote, “Dear Estella: Thank you for writing back. What happened is this. The Grinch was at the Whos’ and he was helping them get ready for Christmas early, like usual. He was wrapping the presents and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”"],["p","“How do you see the next five years of your life?” Mitzi had asked. “What would you like those five years to be like?” Lloyd had answered, “I want us to own a house with a guest room and two bathrooms. I want dogs and maybe a horse. I want us to live securely with our animals.” Plainly moved, Mitzi had turned to Carol. “And what would you like for the next five years?” Instead of speaking, Carol had jumped up and started dancing. She’d danced around the office, gyrating her hips, singing a wordless song, her hands out as if she were holding onto somebody’s thrusting hips. Mitzi had stared in horror. Her husband had laughed, as if it actually made him happy to see her dance, and maybe it did. They used to dance in the living room like that, wildly and comically."],["p","“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;right when he was wrapping his present for his favorite little Who girl, she ran up and said, ‘Is that for me? Can I see it?’ She got so close that she saw the present and the surprise was ruined. And the Grinch snapped at her and made such a terrible face that she cried and ran away.”"],["p","Lloyd had laughed in the therapist’s office but he cried in his sleep and tried to punch her in the face. The next day at breakfast he said, “You’ve dishonored me.” She pounded the table and cried out, “I’ve ",["em","dishonored"]," you? What is this, the Army? If it is, I’ve been the good soldier. I’ve paid for everything! And I don’t care about honor anymore. I want to live! I want love! I want love!”"],["p","“You have love,” he replied. “What you want is to destroy yourself.”"],["p","“Every woman I’ve ever been with said she loved me,” her boyfriend had said. “I don’t even want to hear it.”"],["p","“How about if I say it and you verbally abuse me?” she’d suggested."],["p","He’d considered this for a moment. Then he’d said, “You’re desperate for something. I don’t really know what it is but that’s O.K. I like desperate people.”"],["p","“The Grinch was so embarrassed that he went into his room and didn’t even come out for dinner. But when a kind Who mother—she saw what had happened—brought him some food, he realized he had to come back out. When he came out and saw the little girl he’d scared, he tried to smile at her. But, because he was ashamed and didn’t feel like smiling, it came out like a terrible Grinch-face and she just ran away again. Which was too much for the Grinch. He went to his room, opened the window, summoned his Winged Assistants, and fled back to his cave.”"],["p","The murderer, the serial killer, had been cornered as he loomed above his terrified victim. “Drop the gun!” an agent cried. “We know what you’re going through!” But the murderer was too desperate to surrender; he tried to shoot the agents and went down in a hail of bullets. Carol turned off the TV. Somehow, somewhere inside her, love and torture had got squished together. And it wasn’t just in her. As the idiot box dutifully confirmed, it was always happening, of course it was happening: torture disguised as love and healing, and sometimes the other way around. Love would always try to love, and torture could only torture. People try to make the two things be friends—",["em","we know what you’re going through!"],"—and sometimes it even seemed as though they could be; they were, after all, often attracted to each other."],["p","She could not think of what else the Winged Assistant could say about the Grinch, so she just went to

woke early the next morning and decided to go for a walk. It was clear and cold when she started out, but clouds rolled in suddenly and it started to snow. The snow made the town quiet; it seemed as if the only people on the street were old men walking heavily, as though they were coming to the end of a long journey. The sudden snowfall had a bleak magic that touched a simple place in her: the need for and love of home. The old gas station with its flying horse, the hardware store called Crest, the gift store with its assortment of novelty belt buckles, coasters, artificial flowers, and hand-knit purses, the liquor store that gave you discount points, the small, elegant oblong of an apartment building with “The Saratogan” spelled across its stucco front in stylish metallic script—what kind of person would put that building here, and what would it be like to live under the fading spell of its signage? She heard church music, so faint on the wind that it was like something at the very bottom of a half-remembered dream: not beautiful but mysterious, a toiling incantation, with voices surging under it and a lone voice shouting over it, vibrating between supplication and command. Baptist, she thought, and turned intuitively down a side street toward the sound."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c115dffef12204ae0c05e19%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c115dffef12204ae0c05e19%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c115dffef12204ae0c05e19%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c115dffef12204ae0c05e19"}]],["p","It was a street of houses that looked put together as if they were toys, fast and with secret, cockeyed affection. One of them, originally white, had been roughly painted with giant superheroes speeding in fight mode across its walls, their faces blurred and their shapes too botched to be recognizable except—great red Christ!—there was Spider-Man, his arms spread triumphantly between two upper-story windows, scarlet toes grazing the frame of the front door, friends and enemies ranged about him like angels, menacing and celebrating."],["p","The house was mischievous and pagan, but still it seemed in league with the church just a few doors down. The church was a triangular building with a modest personality, despite the pink-and-green neon sign announcing “Springfield Baptist Church,” which protruded from its side like a thought balloon. Its main door was open and thronged with people, and the organ music poured out, toiling and mysterious no more, rising with ease and cheer. A black man in a dark suit with a woollen scarf around his neck stood at the center of the congregation as people came to him singly and in groups, black people brightly dressed in their good coats and winter boots, smiling adults and children bursting with energy, one boy breaking away to make a snowball that he hastily dropped at his mother’s command. Carol stopped in her tracks. ",["em","The Acceptance Journey!"]," Her heart beat with amazement and she impulsively crossed the street, hesitated, then got in line behind a cluster of middle-aged women, who were being greeted fulsomely by the gentleman at the door. “What you doin’ out here in this weather, pastor?” a frosted-haired lady asked in a joyful and submissive voice. “Where’s Jerome?” “Jerome is not feeling well today, Miss Janice, and, besides, I want to welcome back sister Eunice, first time back since she broke her hip!” The women praised God with words and powerful “um-hmm”s. Then one of them noticed Carol with a quick up-and-down."],["p","Carol was suddenly timid. The man did not look at all like a pastor to her. He was slender, straight-backed, and youthful in appearance, martially impervious to the cold, with a strict manner that was accentuated by his suit. Carol now felt confusion on top of timidity, and she must have communicated it because he appraised her sideways before she even got to him, and when he met her eyes it was with the look of someone assessing a possible problem. But, even with those eyes, he took her hand and spoke with sharp, shapely kindness. “Welcome, sister. You’re visiting our fellowship today?”"],["p","“I don’t know,” Carol said, aware of the women regarding her with erect alertness. “I wanted to ask&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She trailed off. The women were all wearing skirts and high-heeled boots. She was wearing black jeans and a gray parka."],["p","“You are welcome to pray with us,” he said, softening his eyes, even squeezing her hand, realizing, it seemed, that he was merely looking at a confused and timid woman. “I’m Pastor Robertson, and you are?”"],["p","“Carol,” she said and hesitated. “Um, I was wondering, do you do Acceptance Journeys here?”"],["p","“We accept everybody,” the pastor replied. “More important, Jesus accepts everybody. We accept—” He looked past her with a burst of feeling. “Hello, Strongs! Glad to finally see ",["em","you"],", sir!” A smiling, middle-aged couple walked past, woolly in their coats. Politely, Pastor Robertson turned back to Carol. “We accept everybody in Jesus. Is it something particular you are needing today, Karen?”"],["p","“Something called an Acceptance Journey?”"],["p","“You mean a faith journey?”"],["p","“No, it’s Acceptance Journey. I saw it advertised on a billboard on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She realized her mistake but did not know how to get out of it. “It’s a picture of people hugging each other,” she said. “Like some kind of special group where people&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”"],["p","A look of understanding came to the man, followed by an adamant adjustment of his expression. “I know the billboard you are referring to,” he said a little curtly. “We don’t do that here—Hey! I saw your boy out on the field the other day, he looked great!” A bouquet of smiles and friendly sounds went past in the quietly thickening snow."],["p","“You can come in and pray with us if you want to,” the pastor said, coming back to Carol. “But we don’t offer what you are looking for.”"],["p","Carol blushed; she opened her mouth and tried to speak. But the pastor turned away to greet a very old white woman hobbling on a walker, assisted by a young light-skinned black woman with a kind and intrepid face. The old woman looked down with pulled-in lips, concentrating all her effort on moving forward, but the young woman faced Pastor Robertson with confident expectation, which he answered without missing a beat. “Roberta! So glad to see you, my dear! Eunice, God bless you—” and Carol walked away. She didn’t even feel that she was being rude, or, more precisely, she didn’t care. She felt rebuffed and bewildered. ",["em","We don’t do that here"],"—don’t do what? She walked down the block, fumbled in her purse for her phone, and tried to Google “Acceptance Journey.” But she had no service. She walked all the way around the block, Googling vainly and repeatedly; when she arrived back at the church, the door was closed. She stood before it, listening to muffled music and voices crying “Jesus!”"],["p",["em","My name is Legion"],"—well, no wonder she’d said it. There was a legion of voices and faces in her and around her, cruel and ruthless and loud, talking gigantically and dancing lewdly while between their prancing legs a blind little creature stumbled, squeaking, “I want love, I want love!” Carol was touched by the image of the old woman with her walker, working so hard to move forward. She wished she could go into the church and pray, but she couldn’t imagine herself there, among good people so profoundly linked. Instead she closed her eyes and listened to the music and prayed. She saw the naked prostitute running in the desert; the woman was playing a part she’d chosen, at least in the movie, but still Carol prayed for her, for people to find her and give her water, wrap her in cool sheets, take her to where she could be nourished and get well. She couldn’t imagine people helping the man who had tortured her, so instead she prayed for angels—masculine angels with wings like those of powerful birds or bats, strong and leathery, the tendons and bones visible—who would wrap him in those wings and the wings would speak to him and hold him."],["p","The music stopped.

Very soon after that a friend had sent her a video set to a bombastic love song, about a lion who’d been rescued as a cub, ecstatically embracing his rescuer and rubbing against him like a cat.

Carol glanced at the girls; Estella was looking supercilious, Ada was eating her bread with greasy, dream-faced absorption. Dana said that there was a possibility that the woman Carol was replacing might not come back, which would mean that Carol might be able to stay on, if she wanted. Carol said, “Oh, really! Nobody told me that!”"],["p","She came home around nine, had a juice jar of wine, watched a movie about a heroic horse that had fought for the Allies in the First World War, and typed a text message she didn’t send.

The plows had come and banked the snow, which was now falling lightly or perhaps just drifting.

early 2017, Mosul was half free. The city is bisected by the Tigris River. Its east side has wide avenues and low buildings. Backed by coalition airpower, East Mosul was taken mostly by élite Iraqi counterterrorism forces, fighting house to house. They took care to minimize civilian casualties, and suffered tremendous losses of their own. By the end of the battle for East Mosul, as much as seventy-five per cent of the counterterrorism forces had been injured or killed."],["p","The combat was much worse in West Mosul—especially in the Old City, a densely populated warren of alleyways, tunnels, and souks nestled against the banks of the Tigris. Its streets were too narrow for armored vehicles to pass through, and jihadis could easily slip between roofs and alleys and basements. To an outside force, it was practically impenetrable. The coalition bombed all five of Mosul’s bridges and sealed off the western escape valve, while thousands of Iraqi soldiers, federal police officers, and Hashd fighters besieged the Old City."],["p","The Old City was home to Mosul’s richest history and poorest residents. Thenoon Younnes Abdullah, a middle-aged father with a bushy mustache, dyed brown, had spent the past couple of decades working as a day laborer, until his body gave out; to provide for his wife, Alaa, and their four children, he resorted to selling bootleg gasoline. Like most of his neighbors, he resented the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," fighters, who swaggered through the souks, flush with cash, telling him how to live—especially the foreigners, who barely spoke Arabic and had no connection to Mosul. Some of them had converted to Islam only a few months before coming to Iraq for the jihad. Abdullah’s family had lived in the same cluster of houses, on the same block, with the same neighboring families, for as many generations as he could remember."],["p","For three years, the Iraqi Army had told civilians to stay at home and wait for liberation, and Abdullah and his family had listened. Now, as the Army encircled the Old City, electricity and water supplies were cut off, and life became impossible. People began to starve. The jihadis were breaking into homes, stealing food, and digging tunnels between basements, to pass undetected. They set up firing positions on people’s roofs, and stockpiled explosives in living rooms. Anyone who resisted was killed."],["p","The coalition concluded that the Old City could not be captured according to the rules of engagement that had governed the battle in East Mosul, so it loosened its requirements for calling in an air strike. In March, the U.S. dropped a five-hundred-pound bomb on a roof in the Old City, in an effort to kill two ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," snipers. The explosion killed a hundred and five civilians who had been sheltering inside the building. Survivors reported that there were no ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," fighters in the vicinity at the time of the strike."],["p","One night, when the shelling relented, Abdullah and his family hurried downhill to the banks of the Tigris, carrying inner tubes and two large coolers. None of them knew how to swim. Abdullah helped the kids into the coolers—two in each—and he and Alaa climbed onto the inner tubes, clinging to the children and each other as they floated downstream, to liberated territory."],["p","By early July, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," fighters had killed thousands of government troops and police officers, and Iraqi commanders were under enormous pressure to finish the battle. The next few weeks were a bloodbath. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," fighters who surrendered were executed on the spot. Iraqi security forces filmed themselves hurling captives off a cliff, then shooting them as they lay dying on the rocks below. Helicopters buzzed the Tigris, bombing people as they tried to swim across. The troops assumed that anyone still living in the Old City sided with the Islamic State. For the rest of the month, corpses bobbed downstream, dressed in civilian clothes. “We killed them all—Daesh, men, women, and children,” an Iraqi Army officer told a Middle Eastern news site, using the Arabic acronym for ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"],". As he spoke, his colleagues dragged a suspect through the streets by a rope tied around his neck. “We are doing the same thing as ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"],".

year and a half after Iraq declared victory, the Old City is in ruins. Sunlight gleams through bullet holes in tin garage doors. Massive blocks of concrete dangle from broken roofs. The floors of apartment buildings remain as they fell, in layers, having crushed whatever was between them. The U.N. estimates that the battle for Mosul has left behind around ten million tons of rubble. Some stone structures have landed at odd angles, to disorienting effect, as if gravity were pulling in every direction. There are burned-out power lines, and staircases to nowhere. It is completely silent. Near the site of an old post office, there is a single intact traffic light. It changes every thirty seconds, for no one. Every few feet you catch the smell of desiccated corpses. Also inescapable is the scale of history, obliterated. Many of the buildings were continuously inhabited from the seventh century until the second week of July, 2017. To walk through the Old City is to tread on its final generations’ graves."],["p","Shortly after the battle ended, Mohammad returned to his job in the civil defense. Every day, locals lined up outside a temporary fire station in West Mosul and asked for help retrieving the bodies of their relatives. “We recorded their names and gave them a date,” he recalled. “And when their date came they would come with us to the Old City and show us the house that had been hit by an air strike, and we would dig until we could take out the body.”"],["p","The coalition has acknowledged a civilian death toll in the low hundreds. But the West Mosul civil defense has retrieved thousands of corpses from the Old City. Last December, the Associated Press obtained a list of nearly ten thousand civilians whose bodies had been registered at the local morgue. Most had been crushed to death by falling concrete; for others, the cause of death had been entered into the morgue’s database simply as “blown to pieces.” (Thomas Veale, a U.S. Army colonel and a spokesman for the coalition, told the A.P. that it was “irresponsible” to draw attention to civilian casualties in West Mosul. If not for the coalition’s campaign, he said, Iraqis would have suffered years of “needless death and mutilation” at the hands of “terrorists who lack any ethical or moral standards.”)"],["p","“All of them are civilians,” Mohammad said. “When we find unknown bodies, we leave them behind,” because there would be no way to apply for a death certificate or to return a corpse to its family for burial. “Sometimes people come here and tell us that they have dead relatives in the Old City, but we know that they are not ",["em","from"]," the Old City,” Mohammad said. “They are from Qayyarah or Shirqat,” towns where the Islamic State had more support.

Haider al-Abadi, who served as Prime Minister between 2014 and October, 2018, dismissed them as “individual acts” for which the perpetrators would be held to account. But there have been no meaningful investigations. According to the senior Iraqi intelligence official, “all Hashd violations are carried out with the knowledge and approval of the national-security apparatus, in all governorates.” He added that the government has provided official cover for numerous civilian massacres, by organizing press conferences and lying about the provenance of mass graves. “The Iraqi government brought in journalists and said, ‘Look, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," killed these civilians,’ when in fact it was the Hashd al-Sha’abi,” he said. “The reality is totally different from what ends up in the media.

ask.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%20Baghdad%2C%20the%20relentless%20pace%20of%20trials%20struck%20me%20as%20so%20incongruous%20with%20the%20lack%20of%20evidence%2C%20the%20certainty%20of%20convictions%2C%20and%20the%20severity%20of%20sentences%20that%20I%20began%20to%20wonder%20whether%20judges%20had%20access%20to%20secret%20intelligence%20reports%20that%20they%20weren%E2%80%99t%20sharing%20in%20court.%20One%20evening%2C%20I%20visited%20the%20office%20of%20Munir%20Haddad%2C%20a%20magistrate%20who%20presided%20over%20the%20trial%20of%20Saddam%20Hussein.%20It%20was%20a%20troubled%20proceeding%E2%80%94defense%20lawyers%20were%20assassinated%2C%20and%20the%20Prime%20Minister%20pressured%20judges%20into%20issuing%20a%20death%20sentence%E2%80%94but%2C%20compared%20with%20the%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EISIS%3C%2Fem%3E%20trials%2C%20Haddad%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20believe%20the%20process%20was%20reasonably%20transparent.%20Saddam%20had%20lawyers.%20Only%20six%20or%20seven%20people%20were%20executed.%20These%20days%2C%20in%20terrorism%20courts%2C%20at%20least%20twenty-five%20people%20are%20sentenced%20to%20death%20every%20single%20day.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHaddad%20lit%20a%20cigarette%20and%20threw%20his%20legs%20over%20an%20elegant%20wooden%20chair.%20Ali%20Shimari%2C%20a%20handsome%20young%20lawyer%2C%20sat%20next%20to%20him.%20Haddad%20left%20the%20bench%20years%20ago%3B%20he%20and%20Shimari%20now%20work%20as%20a%20team%2C%20defending%20terrorism%20suspects%20whom%20they%20believe%20to%20be%20innocent.%20That%20morning%2C%20Shimari%20had%20sat%20through%20the%20same%20hearings%20that%20I%20had.%20%E2%80%9CEverything%20that%20the%20judge%20saw%2C%20the%20lawyers%20saw%2C%20too%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s%20usually%20no%20evidence%2C%20just%20the%20confession.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%20asked%20Shimari%20if%20the%20arbitrary%20nature%20of%20the%20trials%20frustrated%20him.%20%E2%80%9CWhat%20can%20I%20do%3F%E2%80%9D%20he%20replied%2C%20shrugging.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20a%20defense%20lawyer.%20I%20can%E2%80%99t%20tell%20the%20judge%20to%20pay%20attention.%20You%20can%20try%20once%20or%20twice%2C%20but%20it%20has%20no%20effect.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHaddad%20laughed.%20%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20not%20in%20America%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20not%20possible%20to%20argue%20with%20the%20judge%2C%20because%20if%20you%20do%20he%E2%80%99ll%20just%20take%20it%20out%20on%20your%20client.%20As%20a%20lawyer%2C%20you%20just%20have%20to%20accept%20the%20humiliation.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inline-ad%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cp%253Eadvertisement%253C%252Fp%253E%255Cn%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cp%3Eadvertisement%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EI%20asked%20Haddad%20whether%2C%20as%20a%20former%20judge%20in%20Iraq%E2%80%99s%20highest-profile%20tribunal%2C%20he%20believed%20that%20judges%20see%20their%20role%20as%20meting%20out%20a%20kind%20of%20cosmic%20justice%2C%20even%20if%20the%20truth%20lies%20beyond%20the%20kinds%20of%20evidence%20that%20can%20plausibly%20be%20collected.%20%E2%80%9C%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EISIS%3C%2Fem%3E%20has%20so%20many%20victims%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CThere%20have%20to%20be%20convictions.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522feature-medium%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5c104b8b34e30108b56d7e6f%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c104b8b34e30108b56d7e6f%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c104b8b34e30108b56d7e6f%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c104b8b34e30108b56d7e6f%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EThaer%20Abd%20Ali%20al-Juboori%2C%20the%20spokesman%20for%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Justice%2C%20told%20me%20much%20the%20same%20thing.%20%E2%80%9CHuman-rights%20groups%20focus%20on%20the%20rights%20of%20suspects%2C%20but%20what%20about%20the%20rights%20of%20the%20victims%20and%20their%20families%3F%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CWe%20have%20undergo

Baghdad, the relentless pace of trials struck me as so incongruous with the lack of evidence, the certainty of convictions, and the severity of sentences that I began to wonder whether judges had access to secret intelligence reports that they weren’t sharing in court. One evening, I visited the office of Munir Haddad, a magistrate who presided over the trial of Saddam Hussein. It was a troubled proceeding—defense lawyers were assassinated, and the Prime Minister pressured judges into issuing a death sentence—but, compared with the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," trials, Haddad said, “I believe the process was reasonably transparent. Saddam had lawyers. Only six or seven people were executed. These days, in terrorism courts, at least twenty-five people are sentenced to death every single day.”"],["p","Haddad lit a cigarette and threw his legs over an elegant wooden chair. Ali Shimari, a handsome young lawyer, sat next to him. Haddad left the bench years ago; he and Shimari now work as a team, defending terrorism suspects whom they believe to be innocent. That morning, Shimari had sat through the same hearings that I had. “Everything that the judge saw, the lawyers saw, too,” he said. “There’s usually no evidence, just the confession.”"],["p","I asked Shimari if the arbitrary nature of the trials frustrated him. “What can I do?” he replied, shrugging. “I’m a defense lawyer.

There is immense public pressure on the judicial authorities.” He continued, “9/11 left three thousand people dead. The whole world obsessed over this attack. We cried for your innocent deaths. But, here in Iraq, we have had a terrorist death toll that has exceeded that by a factor of a hundred. Where is the sympathy that we have shown to the victims of 9/11? This is what Iraqis are upset about. We fight terrorists every day, on behalf of the rest of the world. And no one cares about our suffering.”"],["p","The amount of time that convicts spend on the waiting list to be hanged fluctuates between months and years, because each execution order requires a signature from the President of Iraq. Barham Salih, a progressive Kurd, who was imprisoned and tortured by Saddam Hussein’s regime, assumed the Presidency in October."],["p","In the past, Salih has distinguished himself through his opposition to capital punishment. In 2002, when he was Prime Minister of the eastern part of Kurdistan, he refused to sign the death warrant for an unrepentant Al Qaeda sympathizer who had attempted to kill him. “I think this is a fundamental question of what type of society we want,” Salih said at the time. “I don’t believe that anyone, or the state, should take people’s lives.” Sixteen years later, it’s not clear that any Iraqi Presidency could survive such a stance. Throughout the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," period, in the aftermath of terrorist attacks, the Iraqi government has carried out mass executions in order to mollify an outraged public. I wrote to Salih’s press secretary, Lukman Faily, several times, to ask whether Salih is signing execution orders, but did not hear back."],["p","Execution orders are carried out by the Ministry of Justice. In 2009, Al Qaeda operatives detonated a car bomb outside the ministry’s headquarters, killing thirty-five employees. Four years later, terrorists attacked the replacement headquarters. “Every time we publicized an execution, we would get attacked,” Juboori recalled. Afterward, staffers demanded to be moved to the Green Zone or to have the task of executing convicts referred to a different department. But after a few days they gave up and went back to work. “We have to earn a living,” Juboori said. Today, the ministry occasionally publishes the numbers of people executed, but leaves out the names; by obscuring the identities, Juboori said, the ministry can accede to the public’s demand for results while minimizing the likelihood of retaliatory attacks."],["p","To human-rights groups and foreign officials, the Ministry of Justice’s opacity is a source of frustration. “Often we would find out about mass executions by reading about them on the justice minister’s Facebook page,” a European diplomat, who spent much of the past three years in Baghdad, told me. “There will be some notification saying that they’ve killed forty-two terrorists. O.K., but who? Of which nationalities?” Juboori denied that this was the case; after a foreign fighter is executed, he said, his colleagues put the body in a refrigerated chamber, and inform the relevant embassy."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inline-ad%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3Eadvertisement%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["p","advertisement"]],["p","The Iraqi judiciary has also exposed the willingness of Western liberal democracies to quietly regard due process as a strategic disadvantage.

European intelligence agencies are overwhelmed; to carry out comprehensive surveillance on a single target requires a team of around thirty people. And so countries that have outlawed capital punishment are tacitly encouraging Iraq to eliminate their jihadi citizens. “If the Iraqi government were just rounding up and killing Iraqis in this way, we could be more vocal” in criticizing it, the European diplomat said. “But we don’t have any idea what to do about our own citizens.

He ignored it, unlocked his phone, and started reading aloud a prepared statement, occasionally stopping in the middle of a phrase in order to catch his breath. “The idea for this program came to me because Iraq suffered many terrorist attacks, lots of vicious acts of bloodshed,” he read. “This program doesn’t just do interviews. It also shows CCTV, weapons, car bombs, explosives—actual evidence. This has helped maintain pressure against terror groups. It also helps spread awareness to security forces about how terrorist groups operate. It also gives awareness to the citizens to beware terrorist tactics, and helps citizens gain confidence in the security-intelligence establishment.” He paused. “Do you want me to talk about how I pick the prisoners?”"],["p","“Is that in the statement?” I asked."],["p","“I have written a set of responses to questions I expect you to ask.”"],["p","Hassan insisted that he merely offers prisoners “a chance to repent,” and that they take him up on it because they “feel regret.” But the substance and tone of their confessions raise questions. In Mowafaq’s episode, he is marched down a sealed-off street in Mosul, handcuffed and blindfolded, and forced to kneel in front of a line of masked members of the security forces. His blindfold is removed; they’re holding automatic weapons. It looks like the lead-up to a street execution—the director used a split screen to mirror the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," tape—and, as Hassan questions him, it’s not at all clear that Mowafaq, who has already been sentenced to death, knows otherwise."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOn%20July%2010%2C%202017%2C%20a%20twenty-five-year-old%20woman%20from%20Shirqat%2C%20who%20goes%20by%20Umm%20Saleh%2C%20arrived%20at%20a%20camp%20for%20the%20internally%20displaced%2C%20just%20outside%20Qayyarah.%20She%20had%20spent%20the%20previous%20week%20running%20between%20buildings%20in%20Mosul%E2%80%99s%20Old%20City%2C%20where%20an%20air%20strike%20on%20a%20school%20had%20killed%20her%20father%2C%20her%20brothers%2C%20and%20one%20of%20her%20sisters.%20Umm%20Saleh%E2%80%99s%20husband%20survived%20the%20explosion%2C%20but%20amid%20the%20chaos%20the%20couple%20lost%20track%20of%20each%20other%2C%20and%20so%20she%20left%20Mosul%20with%20their%20three%20children%2C%20carrying%20the%20youngest%20in%20her%20arms.%20Members%20of%20the%20Iraqi%20security%20forces%20robbed%20and%20harassed%20Umm%20Saleh%20at%20every%20checkpoint.%20Many%20of%20them%20obscured%20their%20faces%20with%20balaclavas%20and%20masks%2C%20and%20had%20patches%20on%20their%20uniforms%20of%20the%20skull%20worn%20by%20the%20Punisher%2C%20a%20Marvel%20Comics%20antihero%20who%20kidnaps%2C%20extorts%2C%20and%20murders%20people%20in%20the%20pursuit%20of%20his%20own%20conception%20of%20justice%3B%20the%20skull%20is%20the%20last%20thing%20that%20his%20victims%20see%20before%20they%20die.%20%E2%80%9CIf%20the%20Americans%20weren%E2%80%99t%20behind%20us%2C%20we%20would%20burn%20you%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20soldier%20told%20Umm%20Saleh.%20She%20had%20left%20Mosul%20with%20some%20cash%20and%20gold%20but%20arrived%20in%20Qayyarah%20penniless.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EUmm%20Saleh%20expected%20to%20reunite%20there%20with%20her%20husband.%20He%20hadn%E2%80%99t%20joined%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EISIS%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20but%20his%20brothers%20had%20been%20conscripted%20as%20fighters.%20Because%20he%20hadn%E2%80%99t%20denounced%20them%20or%20severed%20ties%2C%20on%20the%20way%20to%20the%20displaced-persons%20camp%20he%20was%20picked%20out%20of%20line%20during%20a%20security%20screening%2C%20and%20taken%20away.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inline-ad%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cp%253Eadvertisement%253C%252Fp%253E%255Cn%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cp%3Eadvertisement%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EOne%20day%2C%20a%20member%20of%20the%20Iraqi%20security%20forces%20visited%20the%20camp%2C%20promising%20to%20look%20into%20the%20cases%20of%20detainees%2C%20for%20a%20fee%20of%20a%20thousand%20dollars.%20Umm%20Saleh%E2%80%99s%20mother%20and%20sister%20sold%20all%20their%20gold%20to%20pay%20the%20bribe%2C%20and%20Umm%20Saleh%20gave%20him%20her%20husband%E2%80%99s%20name.%20The%20soldier%20took%20the%20money%20and%20never%20came%20back.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAt%20the%20camp%2C%20Umm%20Saleh%20was%20placed%20in%20a%20sector%20populated%20by%20widows%20of%20the%20Islamic%20State%20who%20had%20also%20grown%20up%20in%20Shirqat.%20Because%20Umm%20Saleh%E2%80%99s%20husband%20was%20mistaken%20for%20an%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EISIS%3C%2Fem%3E%20fighter%2C%20she%20is%20now%20perceived%20by%20camp%20administrators%20and%20guards%20as%20the%20female%20head%20of%20an%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EISIS%3C%2Fem%3E%20family.%20Her%20children%20are%20growing%20up%20fatherless%20and%20isolated%20from%20the%20rest%20of%20society%2C%20unable%20to%20attend%20Iraqi%20schools.%20%E2%80%9CPeople%20look%20at%20us%20differently%2C%E2%80%9D%20another%20woman%20in%20the%20sector%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9CEven%20small%20children%20in%20the%20camp%20point%20at%20my%20children%20and%20say%2C%20%E2%80%98%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EISIS%3C%2Fem%3E!%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EISIS%3C%2Fem%3E!%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%20The%20government%20refuses%20to%20recognize%20or%20replace%20Umm%20Saleh%E2%80%99s%20infant%20son%E2%80%99s%20birth%20certificate%2C%20because%20it%20was%20issued%20by%20the%20Islamic%20State%3B%20as%20with%20tens%20of%20thousands%20of%20other%20Iraqi%20children%2C%20his%20own%20country%20has%20rendered%20him%20effectively%20stateless.%20The%20camp%20is%20now%20Umm%20Saleh%E2%80%99s%20de-facto%20prison%3B%20Iraqi%20security%20forces%20stole%20her%20identity%20card%20at%20a%20checkpoint%2C%20and%20without%20it%20she%20cannot%20leave.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522feature-medium%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5c12cc9aef12204ae0c06030%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252

There are no social spaces. There are no spaces for the children to play. There are no places for people to gather. There’s one entrance in and out. And have you seen the guys at the entrance? Most of them are from militias.”"],["p","Throughout Nineveh Province, camp administrators and workers routinely deprive ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"],"-linked families of food, clean water, and medical services. The N.G.O. country director told me that he had travelled more than two hundred miles from Baghdad, “to make sure that our Iraqi staff are not falling into these types of revenge attitudes.” He added, “They say, ‘These people killed my family, and now I have to help them?’&nbsp;” In some camps, humanitarian workers offer aid in exchange for sex. Many women are pregnant from having been raped by the security forces or from having sex to feed themselves and their children. Although the fighting has ended, “these camps are meant to stay,” the N.G.O. director said. “If you are ten years old now, and you have no food, no assistance, and your mother has to prostitute herself to survive, and the whole of Iraqi society blames you because you were close to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"],"—in two, three, four years, what are you going to do? It’s clear. The seeds for the next conflict are all here.”"],["p","At a police compound in West Mosul, I asked a colonel named Mezhar Sedoon whether he thought that the camps are creating more security problems than they are solving. “Some of the mothers in the camp are raising ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," children, but others have become prostitutes,” he said.

Others give birth, and discard the babies in unpopulated parts of the camp. Those who are found alive often end up in the care of Sukaina Mohammad Ali Younnis, an Iraqi government official who is in charge of women’s and children’s issues in Mosul. Over tea in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, she showed me hundreds of photographs of children she has found in camps, on the streets, and dead in trash cans. Earlier this year, she saw someone throw a bundle out of a car, and found that it was a baby boy. She showed me a video of herself cradling him in the back of an ambulance, as blood bubbled out of his nostrils. He died on the way to the hospital."],["p","Outside the camps, thousands of other children have been abandoned or orphaned by the war. Many of them were born to Yazidi women who had been kidnapped by ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," and forced into sexual slavery. “After ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"],", the Yazidis accepted the women back into the community, but not their half-",["em",{"class":"small"},"ISIS"]," babies,” Younnis said. “They force the women to turn over their children to the orphanage.

final masterpiece of twentieth-century music had its première last month, at La Scala, in Milan. “Samuel Beckett: Fin de Partie,” an operatic version of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/samuel-beckett"},"Beckett’s"]," “Endgame” by the Hungarian composer György Kurtág, is nominally a product of our time: Kurtág began writing it in 2010 and finished it last year, at the age of ninety-one. Yet the score harks back to the heyday of modernism in the arts, when a figure like Beckett could hold a cultured public tensely in thrall as he tested the extremes. Such authority hardly exists any longer: the age of the dark male genius is past. Given how much brilliant music is being made by new and different voices, the retreat of that cult is not greatly to be mourned. Still, Kurtág’s achievement is stupendous, particularly since this is his first opera and by far the most ambitious undertaking of his career. There are many musical monuments of old age: ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/the-shakespeare-of-opera"},"Monteverdi’s"]," “The Coronation of Poppea,” ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/09/24/verdis-grip"},"Verdi’s"]," “Otello” and “Falstaff,” ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1991/03/04/janacek"},"Janáček’s"]," “From the House of the Dead.” But no composer has ever taken so huge a leap so late."],["p","Until now, Kurtág has been best known as a maker of supercharged miniatures. He developed fitfully, struggling through periods of creative block. In the nineteen-sixties, at a time when his compatriot and friend ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/05/28/ligeti-split"},"György Ligeti"]," was seizing the world’s imagination with his “Atmosphères” and “Requiem,” Kurtág remained relatively obscure. Ligeti had fled to the West after the suppression of the Hungarian uprising of 1956; Kurtág had remained in Budapest. By the eighties, though, Kurtág’s time had come. Works such as “Kafka Fragments,” for voice and violin, and “Stele,” for orchestra, rose like craggy monoliths above the stylistic landscape of the day. Their musical language was compressed, gnomic, piercingly expressive. “Stele,” whose title means “memorial slab,” begins with an emphatic held G, extracted from Beethoven’s Leonore Overture No. 3, and ends with catatonic repetitions of a ghostly, shiver-inducing seven-note chord."],["p","This aesthetic of shattered lyricism and occluded beauty is ideal for Beckett. At Ligeti’s urging, Kurtág went to see “Endgame” in Paris in 1957, shortly after its première. Fifty years later, he told the critic Jeremy Eichler that it was “one of the strongest experiences in my life.” He set several shorter Beckett texts and dreamed of writing a full-length opera. Although Beckett was an astute music lover, cherishing the songs of Schubert above all, he resisted musical settings of his plays, deeming the words music enough. He might have changed his mind if he could have heard what Kurtág has done with “Endgame.” The opera, which lasts two hours without intermission, contains a bit more than half the play, following the original French line by line. (Although Kurtág gives us the heart of the text, including the beginning and the end, he has indicated that he plans to expand the score in coming years.) The music hovers around Beckett’s language without ever obscuring or upstaging it. Not since ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/the-velvet-revolution-of-claude-debussy"},"Debussy’s"]," “Pelléas et Mélisande” has there been vocal writing of such radical transparency: every wounded word strikes home."],["p","“Pelléas” is one of the models that Kurtág reportedly examined during a long period of preparation for “Fin de Partie.” In his youth, he studied with Olivier Messiaen, who made a specialty of analyzing “Pelléas”; you hear echoes of Messiaen in “Fin de Partie” as well. Two wheezing bayans—the Russian version of the accordion—lend the work a streetwise Parisian flavor, particularly when they are joined to a mangled little waltz melody that recurs throughout. The Frenchness of the opera may come as a surprise, given Kurtág’s Central European background, but he has long-standing Paris associations and lived in the South of France from 2001 to 2015. (He now lives in Budapest, with Marta Kurtág, his wife and artistic partner for seven decades.)"],["p","The other musical ghost who haunts “Fin de Partie” is Anton Webern, the supreme aphorist, whose song-length orchestral pieces have the weight of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/08/endless-mahler"},"Mahler"]," symphonies. Webern was a Schoenbergian purist, expunging almost all traces of tonality from his music. Kurtág is more eclectic in his approach, making frequent use of tonal elements. But he gives them a hard, enigmatic sheen. That waltz tune keeps stopping short after just two bars, so that its simple, major-key contour becomes one more alienated object in Beckett’s garage sale of the human spirit. The power of Kurtág’s creation derives in part from its fusion of Debussy’s poetry and Webern’s pith."],["p","“Endgame,” like so much of Beckett, presents a condition rather than a plot. The characters are Hamm, a blind old man in a wheelchair; Clov, his long-suffering servant; and Nell and Nagg, Hamm’s ancient parents, who lost their legs in a bicycling accident and are confined to trash cans. Stories are told; resentments are aired; misery circulates; Nell and Nagg die; and, at the end, Clov prepares to take his leave, though he does not actually do so. Outside is a dead, ashen world. Clov declares, “I say to myself that the earth is extinguished, though I never saw it lit.” Pierre Audi, who directed the La Scala production, stayed close to Beckett’s stage directions, though the characters are seen outside a decrepit old house rather than in its interior. The cast—Frode Olsen as Hamm, Leigh Melrose as Clov, Leonardo Cortellazzi as Nagg, and Hilary Summers as Nell—sang magnificently, under the exacting guidance of the conductor Markus Stenz."],["p","Beckett humanizes his desolate scenario with skeletal wit. Kurtág, likewise, proves to be a deft musical comedian. Grunts of tuba and bassoon, scuttlings of strings, a splash of saxophone, and slapstick percussion hint at the vaudeville tradition that informs so much of Beckett’s work. More often, though, the music provokes not outright laughter but a wistful smile—humanization in a different mode."],["p","Hamm, in his opening monologue, says, “No, all is absolute, the bigger a man is the fuller he is. And the emptier. Clov! No, alone. What dreams! Those forests! Enough, it’s time it ended, in the refuge, too. And yet I hesitate, I hesitate to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to end.” Kurtág’s setting of these lines exemplifies his method. First, a prowling tuba and eerie whooshes of tam-tam and cymbals evoke Hamm’s solitude. The word “empty” is unexpectedly joined to a low F-major triad, and a solo double bass traces out a plaintive micro-melody in that key area. A solo flute takes up the same motif in the area of D, bathing it in warm light. The mention of dreams and forests—beloved habitats of Baudelaire and the Symbolist poets—triggers hazy, Debussy-like chords in the strings. The harmony darkens again as Hamm speaks of ending it all."],["p","Each page of the score contains happenstance charms and fleeting epiphanies. I especially love the bouncy little march that kicks in when Nagg tells an old Jewish joke about a tailor who exasperates a client by taking too long to make a pair of pants. God made the world in six days, the client says; it takes you months to make a pair of pants. In the score, the episode carries the heading “Poldy Bloom Singing a Jewish-Irish-Scottish Ballad.” When the punch line arrives—“My dear sir, look at the world, and look at my trousers”—Kurtág tells the performers to think of Mussorgsky’s “Pictures at an Exhibition,” and in particular of the movement depicting an argument between two Jews. Kurtág is of part-Jewish descent, and these intertwined allusions to Beckett’s fondness for Jewish jokes, Mussorgsky’s caricatures of Jews, and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/james-joyce"},"Joyce’s"]," portrait of Leopold Bloom make one wonder if the composer thinks of “Endgame” as a post-Holocaust work, as Theodor&nbsp;W. Adorno did before him."],["p","Joyce once boasted that the puzzles of “Ulysses” would keep the professors busy for centuries. The same might be said of Kurtág’s “Fin de Partie,” although the self-critical composer is unlikely to say so. The opera is less a translation of literature into music than a kind of posthumous collaboration. And, like Verdi’s “Otello,” it seems the equal of the celebrated text on which it is based.

A ",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/nyregion/mandarin-duck-central-park-pond.html"},"mandarin duck"],", an intricately colored waterfowl native to East Asia, has taken up residence alongside the mallards in the Central Park Pond, drawing crowds and inspiring memes, dog costumes, and a Twitter account (bio: “I’m not from around here”). Pundits have argued that the frenzy betrays a desire for good news. But perhaps, the Mexico City-born designer Rebeca Méndez suggested the other day, something deeper is at play. “In our own normal life, we have patterns that we are so used to. When something”—an anatine interloper, say—“comes in and breaks that, it’s incredibly exciting,” she said. “The world suddenly collapses—it’s like a wormhole from far-east Asia to Manhattan.”"],["p","Méndez recently curated an exhibition of avian art at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, across the street from the Park. It’s part of the “Selects” series, in which the museum invites a guest to put together a show from objects in its collection. (Previous guest curators include the architect ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/23/a-sense-of-place"},"David Adjaye"]," and Ellen DeGeneres.) Méndez, a National Design Award winner and the director of a U.C.L.A. design lab, focussed on birds partly in response to migration in the news. “We are setting our boundaries tighter and tighter—we are entrenching in our location,” she said. Birds, with their ability to fly away, “represent incredible freedom.”"],["p","On a recent Friday, Méndez and Christina De León, a Cooper Hewitt curator who worked on the show, took a spin through the galleries. In addition to items from the Cooper Hewitt’s holdings (a seventeenth-century falcon hood, a paper-clip-size flying robot), Méndez had included some two dozen taxidermied birds from the National Museum of Natural History, in Washington, D.C., home to six hundred and forty thousand-odd avian specimens collected by explorers and naturalists since 1818."],["p","Inside a room filled with recordings of birdsong, Méndez and De León examined a display case holding a trio of preserved elegant trogons, small red-bellied birds from Mexico and Central America; each was lying on its back, its feet strung together. (Killing specimens for taxonomic research is still an accepted practice.) De León recalled the Museum of Natural History’s hesitation in lending the birds. “They were reticent because they didn’t want the specimens to be treated as curiosities,” she said. When the curators were granted access, the experience was shocking. “It’s just row after row of drawers,” De León said, as the crystalline song of a resplendent quetzal rang out from a speaker. Méndez, who speaks with a soft Mexican accent, nodded gravely. “You cannot help but, first of all, smell the formaldehyde,” she said. “And then you open, and you open to death.”"],["p","At the rear of the room, another vitrine housed a Japanese bamboo birdcage, four taxidermied green-breasted mangos (a type of long-billed hummingbird), and a gold brooch, made around 1870, that featured the preserved head of a sunbird. Méndez gazed at the macabre accessory, which was fitted with a glinting, ruby-red eye. “That was repulsive when I found it,” she said. “I hated it, and I had to have it, because it showed exactly, to me, where we were as a civilization.”"],["p","De León, gesturing toward a necklace by the Norwegian artist Tone Vigeland, made by hammering nails into the shape of feathers, talked about the ubiquity of avian designs in fashion: “You start doing a project, and all of a sudden you start seeing it everywhere.”"],["p","Méndez brought up current events. “Bird migration is a constant flow,” she said. “The earth is screaming at us, in all possible ways, ‘Migration is how we need to exist!’&nbsp;”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c1318f89ec14d553b1aea43%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1318f89ec14d553b1aea43%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c1318f89ec14d553b1aea43%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1318f89ec14d553b1aea43"}]],["p","The pair decided to step outside.

the Beijing police took my brother sightseeing again. Nine days, two guards, chauffeured tours through a national park that’s a World Heritage site, visits to Taoist temples and to the Three Gorges, expenses fully covered, all courtesy of the Ministry of Public Security. The point was to get him out of town during the 2018 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, held in early September. The capital had to be in a state of perfect order; no trace of trouble was permissible. And Zha Jianguo, a veteran democracy activist, is considered a professional troublemaker."],["p","While ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/xi-jinping"},"President Xi Jinping"]," played host to African dignitaries in the Great Hall of the People, the police played host to my big brother at various scenic spots in the province of Hubei, about a thousand kilometres away. A number of other Beijing activists and civil-rights lawyers, including several whom Jianguo knows well, were treated to similar trips. Pu Zhiqiang headed for Sichuan, Hu Jia to the port city of Tianjin, He Depu to the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, and Zhang Baocheng to Sanya, a beach resort on Hainan Island. Kept busy in the midst of natural beauty and attended to closely, they had no chance to speak to members of the foreign media or post provocative remarks online."],["p","This practice is known as ",["em","bei lüyou"],", “to be touristed.” The term is one of those sly inventions favored by Chinese netizens: whenever law enforcement frames people, or otherwise conscripts them into an activity, the prefix ",["em","bei"]," is used to indicate the passive tense. Hence: ",["em","bei loushui"]," (to be tax-evaded), ",["em","bei zisha"]," (to be suicided), ",["em","bei piaochang"]," (to be johned), and so on. In the past few years, the ",["em","bei"]," list has been growing longer, the acts more imaginative and colorful. “To be touristed” is no doubt the most appealing of these scenarios, and it is available only to a select number of troublemakers. In Beijing, perhaps dozens of people a year are whisked off on these exotic trips, typically diehard dissidents who have served time and are on the radar of Western human-rights organizations and media outlets. Outside the capital, the list includes not just activists but also petitioners (",["em","fangmin"],")—ordinary people from rural villages or small towns who travel to voice their grievances to high government officials about local malfeasances they have suffered from."],["p","Jianguo became a tourist only in recent years, but he has been a target of governmental attention for more than two decades. In 1999, he was given a nine-year prison sentence for helping to found a small opposition group, the Democracy Party of China, the year before. Since his release, in 2008, he has lived under constant police surveillance, which is ratcheted up during “sensitive” periods. For three months surrounding the Beijing Summer Olympics that year, the police parked in front of his apartment building night and day. Officers periodically knocked on his door to search his home, and followed him everywhere he went. Just as polluting factories were shut down and a barrage of rain-dispelling rockets were launched to insure clear skies during the Games, political irritants were vigorously contained."],["p","China has grown wealthier and more powerful in the ensuing years, and, as it hosts more global forums, there are more sensitive dates on the state’s calendar—Party congresses, trade summits, multinational meetings. Old imperial powers, with deep pockets and grand ambitions, tend to be fastidious about their image as host and benefactor, and China has always set great store by ceremony. Each occasion is vulnerable to disruption by protesters, so care is taken to sweep them out of sight. All major state functions have so far run without a hitch: perfect weather, perfect banquets, and perfect citizens waving glow sticks. Since 2011, China’s annual spending on domestic ",["em","weiwen"],", or “stability maintenance,” has, according to some reports, surpassed defense spending."],["p","But how serious is the threat of a disruption? After Jianguo and his comrades launched the Democracy Party, all its leaders were swiftly sent to prison, and, for the past ten years, Jianguo has been a solitary critic, with no party affiliation, no N.G.O. membership, no local or foreign patron. Now sixty-seven years old, he lives alone, having moved to a ground-floor apartment because he tires when climbing stairs. He eats and drinks modestly: mostly vegetables, a light beer or two. Having lost a lot of hair during his prison years, he shaves his head. He used to hold forth at meals; now he listens more than he talks. His smile is serene, as if to convey that all under Heaven is forgiven. Someone remarked to me once, “Your brother looks like a Buddha now.”"],["p","Yet, in recent years, the Chinese government has come to see him as more, not less, of a security threat. The authorities monitor his phone, block some of his messages, and bar him from certain gatherings. During sensitive periods, he is watched and followed around the clock. On ",["em","bei lüyou"]," trips, three officers usually accompany him, often including one who sleeps in his hotel room."],["p","Why do they think he is so dangerous? My brother may no longer operate a party cell, but—like more than a billion other Chinese citizens—he does have a cell phone. He regularly posts his analyses of current events in online groups, and he has become an increasingly prominent pundit on the Chinese Internet. Since 2012, Jianguo has trained his criticism chiefly on one target: the ",["em","Global Times"]," (",["em","Huanqiu Shibao"],"), a pro-government, strongly nationalistic, and influential tabloid daily, which is distributed widely under the auspices of the ",["em","People’s Daily."]," In a series labelled “Debating the ",["em","Global Times"],",” Jianguo took up editorials and scrutinized them point by point."],["p","Looking at his posts, I used to marvel at his bullheadedness, but the whole thing seemed to me like playing a game of solitaire; the posts appeared to go unnoticed. Gradually, however, I saw that Jianguo was honing a new voice, and gaining a following. From 2012 to 2017, he produced, with accelerating frequency, a total of four hundred and fifty-six “Debating the ",["em","Global Times"],"” posts. He was helped by the explosive growth of WeChat, the messaging and social-media app: by 2015, Jianguo was sending a new post every other day to between fifty and seventy WeChat groups, reaching tens of thousands of readers."],["p","He’s part of a broader trend. Since organized opposition is impossible, protest and resistance have increasingly shifted to the Internet. Spotlighting abuse and corruption, online critics and bloggers have often succeeded in rallying public opinion and pressuring authorities to act. Online platforms like WeChat and Weibo, in their fragmented immensity, can still provide badly needed public spaces for critical exchange, as well as bonding and camaraderie, all with the advantage of speed and influence."],["p","Back in the late nineteen-nineties, the Democracy Party of China was a fringe group of radicals whom the government could easily quarantine. Reformist intellectuals, who supported a path of incremental change, viewed men like Jianguo as politically naïve and their mission as suicidal. Few people even knew that his party existed. But now, using social media, Jianguo has accomplished something that his old comrades never could. He has reached the much larger camp of Chinese liberals—educated urbanites who generally embrace Western ideas of democracy, want the rule of law, and are critical of the party-state. Although they have flourished in China’s “reform era”—decades of fast growth that have brought them apartments, cars, holiday travels, study abroad for their children—they are mostly convinced of the superior vitality of the multiparty system. In a joke they liked about the 2016 U.S. election, a bunch of eunuchs are so appalled by the bawdy quarrels among the married folk that they congratulate themselves: “How fortunate we are to be castrated!” Yet many Chinese liberals doubt that the Western system is feasible in their country. They fret about the burden of history, about the prospect of chaos and mob rule. In their own lives, they avoid radicals and former political prisoners, for fear that such association might jeopardize their personal freedom. They shun the sort of political action that could put their comfortable life style at risk."],["p","These are the people I’m friends with in Beijing; they know me as a writer and as someone who, for years, was a regular presence on a moderate-liberal TV talk show that they all watched. (Which is to say, I’m mindful of what lines can’t be crossed when addressing the Chinese public on Chinese airwaves.) So why are so many of these liberals now reading the views of a radical like my brother Jianguo? One factor is the darkening of China’s political landscape. Xi Jinping’s initial speeches as President about “putting power into a cage” had given hope to many liberal pragmatists, but what he really meant quickly became clear: he intended to cage any threats to his own authority. And he has managed to do so through a ruthlessly extralegal anticorruption campaign, all in the name of “strengthening the rule of law under the Party leadership.” Amid ever harsher crackdowns on civil society, many previously tolerated liberals are feeling a chill: every day, there’s more news about arrests, detention, censorship, and blackmail. Investigative journalists, public intellectuals, media critics, college professors, editors and publishers, human-rights lawyers, and environmental activists—nobody feels safe anymore."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOne%20evening%20in%20June%2C%202017%2C%20as%20I%20was%20leaving%20my%20Beijing%20apartment%20to%20meet%20some%20cousins%20of%20mine%20for%20dinner%2C%20I%20got%20a%20text%20message%20from%20a%20friend%2C%20a%20law%20professor%2C%20saying%20that%20the%20police%20had%20taken%20my%20brother%20away.%20Jianguo%20had%20planned%20to%20join%20us%20for%20dinner%20that%20evening%20but%20called%20the%20day%20before%20to%20cancel%2C%20because%20police%20were%20already%20stationed%20outside%20his%20building%2C%20in%20anticipation%20of%20the%20twenty-eighth%20anniversary%20of%20the%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2FTiananmen%2520Square%5C%22%3ETiananmen%20Square%3C%2Fa%3E%20massacre.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522cartoon%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522cartoon%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fcartoon%25252F5c12c19590c3112cd5d89aea%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c12c19590c3112cd5d89aea%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c12c19590c3112cd5d89aea%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c12c19590c3112cd5d89aea%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EWhat%20I%20didn%E2%80%99t%20realize%20was%20that%2C%20the%20day%20before%20his%20arrest%2C%20Jianguo%20had%20posted%20a%20short%20piece%20in%20which%20he%20pointed%20out%20the%20political%20instability%20of%20the%20moment%20and%20the%20possibility%20of%20an%20accidental%20eruption.%20He%20then%20sketched%20out%20a%20potential%20cascade%20of%20protests%20and%20crackdowns%2C%20which%20could%20culminate%20in%20a%20military%20coup.%20The%20next%20day%2C%20while%20the%20piece%20circulated%20among%20his%20WeChat%20groups%2C%20Jianguo%20went%20to%20a%20neighborhood%20massage%20parlor.%20Herbal%20pads%20were%20being%20laid%20on%20his%20face%20when%20the%20manager%20rushed%20in.%20%E2%80%9CSome%20men%20at%20the%20door%20want%20to%20see%20you%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20told%20him%20breathlessly.%20Jianguo%20assumed%20it%20was%20his%20usual%20tails.%20%E2%80%9CTell%20them%20to%20wait%20outside%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20told%20the%20manager.%20But%20a%20moment%20later%20she%20returned%2C%20looking%20terrified.%20The%20men%20had%20shown%20her%20their%20police%20I.D.s%2C%20and%20insisted%20that%20her%20client%20come%20out%20right%20away.%20Jianguo%20knew%20then%20that%20it%20was%20serious.%20%E2%80%9COh%2C%20well%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said%2C%20apologizing.%20%E2%80%9CLooks%20like%20I%20can%E2%80%99t%20finish%20the%20facial%20today.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhen%20I%20got%20the%20news%20of%20Jianguo%E2%80%99s%20arrest%2C%20I%20called%20his%20cell%20phone%2C%20to%20no%20avail.%20After%20alerting%20his%20daughter%2C%20Huiyi%2C%20who%20lives%20in%20Orlando%2C%20I%20set%20off%20for%20the%20restaurant.%20My%20cousins%20were%20concerned%2C%20but%20not%20greatly%3B%20maybe%20we%20had%20all%20grown%20a%20little%20blas%C3%A9%20after%20witnessing%20Jianguo%E2%80%99s%20skillful%20dealings%20with%20the%20police%20for%20so%20many%20years.%20As%20we%20were%20leaving%20the%20restaurant%2C%20I%20got%20a%20message%20from%20a%20family%20friend%20who%20had%20stopped%20by%20Jianguo%E2%80%99s%20apartment.%20I%20clicked%20open%20an%20image%20of%20my%20brother%2C%20seated%20in%20his%20living%20room%2C%20in%20handcuffs%20and%20an%20olive-green%20prison%20uniform.%20The%20police%20had%20brought%20him%20home%20to%20conduct%20a%20search%20but%20were%20about%20to%20take%20him%20away%20again.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%20called%20various%20activists%20and%20lawyers%2C%20and%20made%20plans%20to%20meet%20at%20Jianguo%E2%80%99s%20apartment%20the%20following%20morning.%20My%20friends%20persuaded%20me%20that%20we%20should%20keep%20the%20news%20of%20his%20detention%20to%20ourselves%2C%20and%20make%20private%2C%20direct%20contact%20with%20the%20police.%20The%20next%20morning%2C%20to%20my%20surprise%2C%20I%20reached%20the%20district%20police%20officer%20in%20charge%20of%20the%20case%2C%20Officer%20Liu%2C%20on%20the%20first%20try.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20Jianguo%E2%80%99s%E2%80%94%E2%80%9D%20I%20began%2C%20and%20Liu%20replied%2C%20simply%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20know%20who%20you%20are.%E2%80%9D%20He%20assured%20me%20that%20he%20would%20meet%20me%20straightaway.%20I%20waited%2

He then sketched out a potential cascade of protests and crackdowns, which could culminate in a military coup. The next day, while the piece circulated among his WeChat groups, Jianguo went to a neighborhood massage parlor. Herbal pads were being laid on his face when the manager rushed in. “Some men at the door want to see you,” she told him breathlessly. Jianguo assumed it was his usual tails. “Tell them to wait outside,” he told the manager. But a moment later she returned, looking terrified. The men had shown her their police I.D.s, and insisted that her client come out right away. Jianguo knew then that it was serious. “Oh, well,” he said, apologizing. “Looks like I can’t finish the facial today.”"],["p","When I got the news of Jianguo’s arrest, I called his cell phone, to no avail. After alerting his daughter, Huiyi, who lives in Orlando, I set off for the restaurant. My cousins were concerned, but not greatly; maybe we had all grown a little blasé after witnessing Jianguo’s skillful dealings with the police for so many years. As we were leaving the restaurant, I got a message from a family friend who had stopped by Jianguo’s apartment. I clicked open an image of my brother, seated in his living room, in handcuffs and an olive-green prison uniform. The police had brought him home to conduct a search but were about to take him away again."],["p","I called various activists and lawyers, and made plans to meet at Jianguo’s apartment the following morning. My friends persuaded me that we should keep the news of his detention to ourselves, and make private, direct contact with the police. The next morning, to my surprise, I reached the district police officer in charge of the case, Officer Liu, on the first try. “I’m Jianguo’s—” I began, and Liu replied, simply, “I know who you are.” He assured me that he would meet me straightaway. I waited at Jianguo’s apartment for hours. Just as I was giving up hope, the door opened, revealing several uniformed police officers and Jianguo’s smiling face.

Chinese police state can be at once harsh and accommodating, insidious and absurd. I got a sense of these peculiarities in 2008, when Jianguo was released after almost a decade behind bars, and a team of policemen was assigned to monitor him daily for three months. They were unfailingly polite, even solicitous, bargaining on his behalf at shops and carrying heavy bags for him. One hot afternoon, they helped install an air-conditioner in his apartment. Since they followed him everywhere, I jokingly suggested that Jianguo might as well ride in the police vehicle, to help reduce expenses and pollution. The officers happily obliged. Once, I went along, riding beside the police driver and holding my young daughter on my lap. When Jianguo went out to eat with friends, the policemen, usually two per shift, would take a table at the other side of the room, eating their meals while keeping an eye on him. They began calling him Big Brother (",["em","dage"],"), with a note of affection. Jianguo laughed when he told me; his guards were oblivious of any Orwellian connotations. “But, of course, they are just doing their job,” he added. They were ready to haul him off to jail, he knew, whenever they were ordered to."],["p","With the practice of ",["em","bei lüyou"],", things grew stranger still. On the road, the three policemen assigned to Jianguo would look after him as though they were his assistants: they bought sightseeing tickets, checked in and out of hotels, helped with his luggage, took snapshots of him at scenic spots. They fussed over him at meals, heaping meats and vegetables onto his plate, ladling up additional bowls of soup for him. Sometimes they booked a trip through an agency and ended up travelling for days with a group of real tourists. The all-male quartet aroused curiosity and inspired innocent guesses about their relationships. “So, are you father and sons?” “Colleagues?” And, pointing at Jianguo: “Is he your boss?”"],["p","Of course, their real boss was ultimately Xi, who chairs the National Security Commission. Since Xi became China’s paramount leader, it has been possible to detect a Maoist revival in state politics and stealthy moves to resurrect the chairman’s cult of personality, particularly after Xi got the constitution changed to eliminate Presidential term limits. But the two leaders have strikingly different styles. As Andrew&nbsp;J. Nathan, a China expert at Columbia University, put it to me, in a succinct formulation, “Mao was a chaos guy, whereas Xi is a control guy.” Indeed, Mao sometimes called to mind the Monkey King in the classical Chinese novel, who flipped dizzying somersaults in high clouds and created constant tumult with his magic wand. “The Golden Monkey wrathfully swung his massive cudgel,” Mao wrote, in a famous couplet. “And the jade-like firmament was cleared of dust.” Yet, when it came to the human soul, Mao was a consummate master of control. You could see this in social attitudes he encouraged toward “political criminals.” In Mao’s time, hatred of the “counter-revolutionaries” was widespread and intense. They were viewed as scarcely human “enemies of the people.”"],["p","Xi plainly intends to emulate Mao in all sorts of ways, but he is ruling over a different China. Attitudes have long since mellowed and grown more than occasionally irreverent, even toward the Core Leader himself. To encourage worshipful affection, state media tried to popularize the honorific Xi Dada (Bigbig Xi), which is how one addresses a father or an uncle in various dialects. But other nicknames for the potbellied leader—such as Baozi (stuffed bun) or Winnie-the-Pooh—have gone viral. Defying official bans, stinging satires about a fatuous new emperor have percolated through social media. In Mao’s era, people got shot for such disrespect."],["p","The ranks of the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/communist-party"},"Communist Party"]," are swelling—they’re now pushing past eighty-nine million members—and so are the ranks of corrupt Party cadres. Although online tribes of Little Pinks (as youthful nationalists are called) can turn hysterical and aggressive, most young people join the Party for career opportunities and material gain. Xi has urged a renewal of ideological indoctrination at all levels, but it’s hard to say how effective these efforts really are. The average person hardly notices the robotic Party-speak that has returned to television, or the kitschy propaganda billboards that have become ubiquitous in the streets. Xi’s anticorruption campaigns and nationalist-strongman politics may have won popular support, but true believers are an endangered species in what has become a brazenly pragmatic society."],["p","Sun Liping, a sociologist at Tsinghua University, once argued, in a widely circulated blog post, that the biggest danger China faced was not mass unrest or sudden collapse, as many feared, but inner rot. He referred to several concurrent phenomena: unchecked power overseeing a “warped reform,” entrenched interest groups and fat cats bent on preserving the status quo, and a general unravelling of social trust. If Sun’s thesis is right, the most urgent task for Chinese leaders today is not perfecting “stability maintenance” but taking on the greed and cynicism that have become a national disease. Sun was, however, not optimistic about the prospects for treatment; he thought that the decay had spread through the entire body

lüyou"]," is a symptom of this disease. The scheme would seem to be the brainchild of someone who, alert to how lavishly the state will spend on all security-related affairs, figured out a way to creep through the back entrance of the great government banquet hall to join the feeding frenzy in the kitchen. The aim of ",["em","bei lüyou"]," was plainly to pamper diehard dissidents enough to soften their defiant spirit, but it could also serve as a morale-booster among the rank and file of the security forces. For them, it’s essentially a free vacation that counts as work. In Mandarin, this is called a ",["em","meichai"],", a beautiful duty. Jianguo was taken on four such trips between October of 2017 and September of 2018, providing almost a dozen ",["em","meichai"]," slots for the police. The officers varied as much as the itineraries, and I imagined them haggling over the rotation of these coveted slots. Perks must be shared. Once, Jianguo told me why an elderly policeman was assigned to his team for a trip south: the man was about to retire, and he’d never been to any tropical beaches."],["p","It’s hard to say exactly when ",["em","bei lüyou"]," started, but an early instance reportedly occurred in 2012, and involved a prominent environmental activist named Wu Lihong. A peasant turned crusader, Wu had exposed hundreds of companies that were illegally polluting the water in his home province, Jiangsu. His tenacious campaign to protect the beautiful Lake Tai had earned him the moniker Lake Tai Warrior. In 2007, just as an outbreak of blue-green algae in the lake affected the drinking water of more than two million people, Wu was sentenced to three years in prison. Five years later, during the Communist Party’s eighteenth National Congress, when Xi assumed power, policemen took Wu from his home to visit Xi’an and its celebrated Terracotta Army. Then, in 2014, during another “sensitive period,” the Jiangsu police took him off for “sightseeing and relaxation” at a plush mountain-resort hotel usually reserved for senior state leaders—at, of all places, Lake Tai."],["p","According to Huang Qi, a human-rights advocate in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, ",["em","bei lüyou"]," in Sichuan typically involves ordinary petitioners. The Sichuan police, Huang told a journalist, have sometimes covered the expenses for officers’ friends and relatives as well. The police even paid a “lost-work fee” to those petitioners who negotiated for a compensation of income they were forgoing during the trip. Those who refused to go on the trip, though, were handled roughly."],["p","In Beijing, Jianguo has been treated with more delicacy. On all but one of his trips, he was the lone “guest,” accompanied by three guards. Then, this spring, he refused to go on a scheduled trip. His leg was hurting; he was fed up with the forced excursions. “I’ll stay home—you can monitor me right here all day,” he told the police. They panicked. A charm offensive ensued, as officers kept visiting him with different proposals. Too warm in the south? How about the wooded regions in the northeast? Can’t sleep well with another person in the same room? From now on, you can have a hotel room to yourself. After three rounds of patient coaxing, Jianguo gave in."],["p","In a photograph from his northeastern tour—it was taken by one of his police handlers—he is standing on an observation deck in Hunchun, Jilin Province, which overlooks both a river bordering ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/north-korea"},"North Korea"]," to the south and a range of wooded Russian mountains to the north. “The spot is called Three Countries at One Glance,” Jianguo told me. “For the first time in my life, I actually set eyes on two foreign territories.” Later, when we met up for lunch, Jianguo brought a present for my daughter: a pocket mirror with gilded carvings of an old Eastern Orthodox cathedral, packed in a gaudy gift box. He had bought it at a souvenir shop in Harbin, an old Russified Manchurian city in Heilongjiang Province. I gazed into the mirror and caught an odd expression gazing back at me: was it a grimace or a smile?"],["p","The truth is, I’ve wondered about the possibly corrupting influence of Jianguo’s tangled dealings with the police. That formula of Nietzsche’s comes to mind: If you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze into you. Had Jianguo’s experiences with ",["em","bei lüyou"]," instilled in him a measure of sympathy toward the officers entrusted with his fate? Was it having—in some small part—its intended effect?"],["p","It’s plain that Jianguo’s years of arrests and imprisonment haven’t bent his will. In matters of principle, he has never backed down. He openly condemns the despotic rule of the party-state, and he refuses to stop writing or posting his criticism. But, when he’s in actual contact with the police, he responds to civility in kind. And here things get more complicated, because some police officers have gone further than civility. One officer told him, “I’ve read your book and my admiration for you is total.” The phrase he used, ",["em","wuti-toudi"],", literally means “with four limbs and a head touching the floor”—admiration to the point of prostration."],["p","Even when Jianguo was arrested a year and a half ago, his police guards stopped by a restaurant to let him “have a good meal” before taking him to a secret detention site. The next day, picking him up to go home, they brought him yogurt and a meat pie. During initial questioning about his online post, the police appeared to want to get him off the hook."],["p","“Maybe you didn’t write this piece yourself,” an officer suggested. “Maybe you copied it from some Web site?”"],["p","“No,” Jianguo replied. “I wrote it, and I’m one hundred per cent responsible for it.”"],["p","“O.K., but maybe you haven’t sent it to too many other people besides this one small WeChat group?” The group has about seventy people, closely watched by the police because several members are well-known intellectuals."],["p","“I’ve sent it to a lot of other groups and people,” Jianguo said. “But I can’t recall the list or give you the names.”"],["p","The officers scratched their heads and sighed. They told him they were trying to make it easy for him. Using a term for revered elders, they addressed him as Zha ",["em","lao"],"."],["p","It would be wrong to assume that these policemen were moved to help Jianguo out of human kindness.

Jianguo told me about an insight he had gained from years of prison life. There’s an old Chinese saying: ",["em","jingfei-yijia"],", “cops and gangsters belong to the same family.” The phrase usually suggests a corrupt equivalence between the two, but Jianguo discovered something else: they share a similar code of honor. Honor, though, takes a variety of forms, being associated with character, with money, or with knowledge. According to Jianguo, an implicit hierarchy exists behind Chinese prison walls, with the political prisoners at the top, thieves and other common criminals in the middle, and sex offenders at the bottom. Wealthy convicts bribe jailers for favors. A well-educated inmate enjoys esteem and privileges because the warden can ask him to write papers for an online diploma the warden might be pursuing or to tutor his son for a college exam. Political prisoners enjoy the highest prestige because of the power of their personal courage. Violence—brawls, bullying, beatings—is a daily reality in Chinese prisons. A prisoner of conscience, however, is usually left alone by his fellow-inmates; a tacit distinction is made."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c12c19550c60350034bc59d%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c12c19550c60350034bc59d%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c12c19550c60350034bc59d%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c12c19550c60350034bc59d"}]],["p","I once heard a similar account from the late Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo. At the same time, there have been plenty of reports about officers abusing, even torturing, political prisoners. Two activists I know have told me in detail about their horrendous treatment during detention: one, in Beijing, was savagely beaten and shocked with electric prods; the other, based in Guangzhou, was interrogated continuously for four days and nights, until he suffered a physical breakdown and lost consciousness. Huang Qi, the Sichuan activist, was reportedly beaten and abused in jail, and denied proper medical attention for his ailments. Several detained human-rights lawyers said they were forced to take drugs that made them feel dizzy and enervated. One of them, Xie Yang, told his attorney about his treatment (which also included beatings and sleep deprivation). The attorney made it public; subsequently, on state and social media, Xie renounced his own account as a fabrication. For many observers, it was an updated version of the public self-denunciations of the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cultural-revolution"},"Cultural Revolution"],"."],["p","When I discussed the reports about drugs with Jianguo, he seemed less than persuaded, and told me that police officers he knows scoffed at the suggestion. It was as if, having spent so much time among security personnel, he could now easily inhabit their perspective. He told me a story of milder abuse, an officer deliberately shining a very bright light on a political prisoner’s face during interrogation, making the inmate sweat profusely. “I know both the officer and the prisoner,” my brother said. “The officer has a low opinion of the man, because he considers him a wimp. As a rule, the police are soft on the tough, and tough on the soft. So, if they sense a weakness in you, it will bring out the bully in them.”"],["p","His words reminded me of a sad story about one of his fellow political prisoners. Wen (as I’ll call him) was sentenced to twenty years on charges of “organizing and leading a counter-revolutionary group.” During his first eleven years behind bars, his mother died and his wife divorced him, and he was allowed to see his only child, a girl, just once. In a moment of despair, Wen signed an admission of guilt, in the hopes of having his sentence reduced. After the news of what he’d done spread, a dramatic change in attitudes occurred: inmates made snide remarks, while jailers gave Wen spoiled food and picked on him. He eventually received a reduction of four years, but he was no longer considered a man of honor. His hair swiftly turned white."],["p","In order to persuade Jianguo to stop writing “dangerous articles,” Officer Liu had talked about the prospect of another long sentence. “Look, it’s been exactly nine years since you finished your nine years in prison,” Liu had told him. “If you get another nine years, it wouldn’t be a nice way to live out your old age, would it? Think about your daughter, your grandchildren.” With a small flexing of the wrist, the line suddenly drew taut."],["p","Jianguo has been divorced twice, and Huiyi, his only child, moved to America many years ago. In Orlando, she got her first job, at Disney World, and eventually, with her husband, started two small companies, in real estate and rental management. The companies now have dozens of employees. Huiyi and her husband have a daughter and a son. Jianguo speaks about the family’s immigrant success with parental pride, impressed by their entrepreneurial pluck. He cherishes the annual reunion when his daughter and son-in-law arrive from Florida with their two healthy, bounding children. But, despite Huiyi’s repeated invitations, Jianguo won’t leave China; he fears that he would be forbidden to return."],["p","Others have made a different choice: there has been a growing exodus of dissidents and activists from China, including some of Jianguo’s old Democracy Party comrades, spurred in large part by constant harassment. Economic uncertainties, heightened now by the U.S.-China trade war, are making many affluent Chinese jittery. Some have already decamped or hedged their bets by transferring capital and setting up a second base abroad. In liberal WeChat groups, the mood swings between bravado, defeatist humor, and gloom; rumors about collapsed trade talks are often accompanied by whispered warnings of a coming storm."],["p","Recently, stirred by news of more departures, Jianguo posted an unusually emotional piece, expounding on the nature of patriotism. In his view, it arises from a deep love of the land and the people, not necessarily of the state or the ruling regime. He understands those friends who have decided to leave and wishes them the best for a new life in a freer country. He even appreciates a motto widely quoted in his circles: “Wherever there’s freedom, there is my homeland.” But that’s not ",["em","his"]," motto. “I’ll never leave,” he wrote. He’ll never leave, and he’ll never quit."],["p","That’s what he concluded after a careful consideration of Officer Liu’s warning. “In the end, my mind is clear and at rest, as always,” Jianguo said. He has told me repeatedly that he is prepared to return to prison at any time, for any number of years. My own mind is not at rest; at the moment, I’m all too conscious of the Chinese government’s habit of jailing activists around Christmas, a down period for the media and the diplomatic services. Since Xi came to power, a number of Jianguo’s Democracy Party comrades have been sent back to prison, and their sentences are heavy. At sixty-five, Qin Yongmin, a widely admired activist and the founder of the party’s Hubei branch, is serving a sentence of thirteen years. It is his fourth; he has already spent twenty-six years behind bars. In July, 2017, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Liu-Xiaobo"},"Liu Xiaobo"],", the long-imprisoned Nobel laureate, died of liver cancer during his fourth prison term, set for eleven years. The dissident community, mourning Liu’s death, took note of the cool responses of many Western governments."],["p","Jianguo views these developments soberly. He has long since shed any illusions of fast social change or enduring media attention. “If I’m sentenced for another nine years, or twelve or thirteen years,” he told me calmly, “I’ll just forget about the outside world and focus on my life inside prison. Family and loved ones—well, those thoughts will be there for a while. It will take time. I’ll read some books, play some Go, get on with my cellmates. I’ll try to make the best out of each day. I’ll think about nothing else, nobody else.” I was at once chilled and comforted by his resolve. The words floated back to me: Your brother looks like a Buddha now."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOn%20November%206th%2C%20when%20I%20was%20in%20New%20York%2C%20Jianguo%20texted%20me%20about%20the%20midterm%20elections%20and%20made%20me%20promise%20to%20inform%20him%20of%20the%20results%20as%20soon%20as%20I%20heard.%20He%20was%20going%20to%20a%20dinner%20the%20following%20evening%20with%20some%20Beijing%20intellectuals%2C%20and%20everyone%20was%20keen%20to%20hear%20the%20latest%20news.%20Twelve%20hours%20later%2C%20when%20I%20forwarded%20the%20first%20posted%20results%20to%20his%20WeChat%20account%2C%20a%20message%20flashed%20on%20my%20phone%E2%80%99s%20screen%2C%20informing%20me%20that%20the%20account%20I%E2%80%99d%20directed%20the%20message%20to%20had%20been%20blocked%2C%20and%20that%20%E2%80%9Cno%20information%20can%20reach%20the%20destination.%E2%80%9D%20For%20the%20fifth%20time%2C%20the%20censors%20had%20shut%20Jianguo%E2%80%99s%20account%20down.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EA%20day%20later%2C%20he%20opened%20a%20new%20account%2C%20with%20the%20name%20BeijingZhaJianguo6%2C%20but%20a%20line%20had%20been%20crossed.%20After%20five%20shutdowns%2C%20as%20the%20police%20had%20warned%20him%2C%20he%20was%20blocked%20from%20large%20online%20groups.%20This%20is%20how%20all%20Chinese%20companies%2C%20including%20giants%20like%20Alibaba%20and%20WeChat%E2%80%99s%20owner%2C%20Tencent%2C%20defer%20to%20the%20police%20state.%20Savvy%20Chinese%20Internet%20users%2C%20with%20or%20without%20the%20aid%20of%20a%20V.P.N.%2C%20employ%20all%20sorts%20of%20techniques%20to%20break%20through%20the%20Great%20Firewall%2C%20and%20Jianguo%20has%20definitely%20learned%20a%20few%20tricks%20to%20evade%20the%20censors.%20But%20lately%20the%20situation%20has%20deteriorated.%20On%20certain%20days%2C%20even%20after%20all%20the%20camouflaging%20maneuvers%2C%20a%20fresh%20opinion%20piece%20of%20his%20would%20vanish%20mysteriously%2C%20with%20no%20error%20message.%20Neither%20the%20sender%20nor%20the%20recipients%20would%20even%20know%20that%20something%20had%20gone%20amiss%20unless%20they%20checked%20with%20one%20another.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThis%20is%20%3Cem%3Ebei%20hexie%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20%E2%80%9Cto%20be%20harmonized%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20form%20of%20virtual%20erasure.%20Bent%20on%20transforming%20the%20global%20Internet%20into%20a%20Chinese%20Intranet%2C%20official%20censors%20have%20made%20deft%20and%20extensive%20use%20of%20the%20method.%20You%20may%20know%20about%20Vice-President%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fmike-pence%5C%22%3EMike%20Pence%3C%2Fa%3E%E2%80%99s%20recent%20speech%20on%20the%20Trump%20Administration%E2%80%99s%20China%20policy%2C%20viewed%20by%20many%20as%20a%20declaration%20of%20a%20new%20cold%20war.%20But%20in%20China%20very%20few%20saw%20the%20actual%20text%3B%20it%20was%20met%20with%20swift%20%3Cem%3Ebei%20hexie%3C%2Fem%3E.%20The%20current%20arms%20race%20between%20the%20censors%20and%20the%20censored%20in%20China%20can%20be%20summed%20up%20in%20an%20old%20proverb%3A%20The%20monk%20grows%20taller%20by%20an%20inch%2C%20but%20the%20monster%20grows%20taller%20by%20a%20foot.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ENow%20Jianguo%20has%20been%20shut%20out%20of%20all%20large%20online%20groups.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20forced%20to%20post%20my%20articles%20less%20often%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20announced%20in%20a%20recent%20post.%20He%E2%80%99s%20decided%20to%20write%20longer%20pieces%20and%20send%20them%20to%20smaller%20groups%2C%20in%20the%20hope%20that%20members%20will%20repost%20them%20in%20larger%20groups.%20%E2%80%9CBut%20I%20trust%20that%20all%20free%20voices%20cannot%20be%20blocked.%20Even%20if%20all%20the%20roosters%20are%20silenced%2C%20the%20dawn%20shall%20still%20come.%E2%80%9D%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","On November 6th, when I was in New York, Jianguo texted me about the midterm elections and made me promise to inform him of the results as soon as I heard.

Twelve hours later, when I forwarded the first posted results to his WeChat account, a message flashed on my phone’s screen, informing me that the account I’d directed the message to had been blocked, and that “no information can reach the destination.” For the fifth time, the censors had shut Jianguo’s account down."],["p","A day later, he opened a new account, with the name BeijingZhaJianguo6, but a line had been crossed. After five shutdowns, as the police had warned him, he was blocked from large online groups. This is how all Chinese companies, including giants like Alibaba and WeChat’s owner, Tencent, defer to the police state. Savvy Chinese Internet users, with or without the aid of a V.P.N., employ all sorts of techniques to break through the Great Firewall, and Jianguo has definitely learned a few tricks to evade the censors.

was a time—astonishing to a contemporary New Yorker, shuffling ratlike to a precarious lunchtime perch at a Hale and Hearty Soups—when the places you’d go for a nosh and a cup were genuinely splendid, spacious and rich in an overcharge of luxury. The Israeli Nobel laureate Shmuel Agnon wrote of his first experience as a kid from a town in Galicia visiting a big-city café in Lviv: “Gilded chandeliers suspended from the ceiling and lamps shining from every single wall and electric lights turned on in the daytime and marble tables gleaming, and people of stately mien wearing distinguished clothes sitting on plush chairs, reading big newspapers. And above them, waiters dressed like dignitaries.” All that for the price of a coffee."],["p","One of the pleasures of Pinsker’s book, for anyone with a longing for a lost era of public splendor, is to be introduced to the locales where people shared that splendor. In Vienna, the Café Griensteidl proved a magnet for “malcontents and raisonneurs,” with bentwood chairs and plenty of reading light and newspapers on sticks. The still extant Café Central had an interior like a miniaturized San Marco, with hallucinatory Byzantine columns and swooping enclosing spandrels and squinches. (The fin-de-siècle modernist writer Peter Altenberg listed his address as “Vienna, First District, Café Central.”) Yet in its prime it was a “place of politics,” and crowded with émigré revolutionaries. A famous story had Leopold Berchtold, the Foreign Minister of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, being warned that a great war might spark a revolution in Russia. “And who will lead this revolution?” he scoffed. “Perhaps Mr. Bronshtein sitting over there at the Café Central?” Mr. Bronshtein took the name Leon Trotsky, and did."],["p","For Jews, Pinsker argues, the investment in the café as a social institution was, across Europe through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, particularly intense. The great cafés were “thirdspaces,” neither entirely public nor entirely private; they were escape zones where, contrary to the theme from “Cheers,” people often ",["em","didn’t"]," know your name, or what shtetl you hailed from. A patriotic Polish writer could meet other Polish patriots at a Warsaw café, read the papers, make plans, share poems, or just decide to flee to Paris. A Jewish writer in the same café had first to decide just how Polish to appear, and just how Jewish to remain. This affected how he dressed and whom he sat with, but also which language he wrote in, Yiddish or Polish, and what he chose to write about as he sat there. Pinsker, who teaches Judaic studies at the University of Michigan, tells the story of how, in Warsaw in the nineteen-thirties, a group of Jewish actors came into a café, dressed, as a comic provocation, as “Jews”—in caftans and fake beards—and were urged by the manager to go elsewhere. It was the Jewish regulars who were made most uncomfortable by the practical joke. Not because they were ashamed—as writers, they often wrote unabashedly as Jews—but because they were suddenly made aware of the ambiguities that they relied upon."],["p","The cafés of the various European cities that Pinsker focusses on—Warsaw, Vienna, and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/berlin"},"Berlin"],"—reflected, with startling specificity, the Jewish reality around them. In Warsaw, which had Europe’s largest concentration of Jews (and a vast hinterland of orthodoxy), the struggle for Jews to be both Poles and Jews, or neither Poles nor Jews, takes on particular pathos. The Warsaw café beats out a theme of “Otherness” and “Difference.” Many Jews were at once proud to be different and conscious of being readily “Othered,” even when they felt most at home. In the nineteen-twenties, the poet Antoni Slonimski wrote, in Polish, a poem in which he asserted his dual love of a still gestating Israel and of Poland, merged into the image of a single idealized woman.

Singer wrote of his first night at a famous Warsaw café:"],["blockquote",["p","Before I opened the door&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I tried for some time to summon courage. Why am I trembling like this?—I asked myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I opened the door, and I saw a hall. Opposite, on the other side of the hall, there was a buffet, like in a restaurant. The writers sat by the tables. Some of them ate, others played chess, and some chatted. All of them seemed terribly important to me, full of wisdom and higher knowledge of the kind that elevates man above worldly troubles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I expected someone to ask me who I am, what do I want, but no one approached me. I stood there with wide-open mouth."]],["p","Singer eventually transposed the complexities of that space—the habit of argument and the uncertainty of origin, the pensive love stories shared and the brave assertions never quite backed up—into the humbler cafeterias of the Upper West Side."],["p","The talk and arguments that went on in the cafés covered every imaginable subject under the Jewish sun, and the Gentile ones, too. Emigration, Zionism, assimilation, the flight to America, the urge to stay home. The cafés “are the meeting place of the like-minded,” a journalist wrote in the early years of Berlin’s café culture. “The merchant who wants to consider his affairs and the status of his stocks with someone; the journalist who must hear the latest and must catch up on the day’s events from the newspaper; the man of private means who does nothing and yet wishes to appear as something; officers, students, in short, everyone who has any kind of interest at all in public life.”"],["p","The cafés became theatres of flirtation and romance as well, especially in interwar Vienna. “The presence of so many women in the cafés,” Pinsker notes, “is described in literary texts by mostly male Jewish writers.” One of them, Melech Chmelnitzki, wrote a Yiddish poem titled “Beautiful, Strange Woman in a Noisy Café.” The cafés remained, though, largely a male preserve. Vicki Baum, who began her literary career in Vienna and went on to write “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Hotel-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590179676/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545058287&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Grand+Hotel+baum"},"Grand Hotel"],",” adapted into the movie for M-G-M, said, acidly, “I don’t remember a ladies’ room in the ",["em","Kaffeehaus"],".”"],["p","Each café town had its own character. In Vienna, the café city par excellence, the Jewish cafégoer wanted to seem not Austrian but, instead, a sophisticated cosmopolitan. City pride was the keynote. The patron writer-saint of the Viennese café in the first third of the twentieth century was Karl Kraus, who was at once Jewish and anti-Semitic, a satirist of the cafés and a habitué of them. In Berlin, you had a smaller Jewish population and a simpler problem: the choice seemed more narrowly poised between being Jewish and being German."],["p","And finally, in New York, as café culture was exported, the model of the central café in which all kinds come together often gave way to the neighborhood café that belonged to a subsect, usually on the political left. Emma Goldman, as a young Russian immigrant, found herself at home in New York when she arrived at a Lower East Side café that was well known as an anarchist hangout. The melting pot of New York, curiously, produced the most distinct and separate crucibles, each annealing the complexities of identity into political causes. In every case, you could see your life in a single commercial space."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EPinsker%2C%20lovingly%20attentive%20to%20the%20habitu%C3%A9s%20of%20his%20caf%C3%A9s%2C%20leaves%20the%20economics%20of%20the%20caf%C3%A9s%20quite%20shadowy.%20The%20rule%2C%20still%20in%20place%20in%20much%20of%20Europe%2C%20was%20that%20you%20need%20buy%20only%20a%20cup%20of%20coffee%20to%20occupy%20a%20seat%20indefinitely.%20Customer%20loyalty%20is%20the%20commercial%20principle%20here.%20Better%20to%20sell%20the%20same%20writer%20a%20hundred%20cups%20of%20coffee%20than%20to%20sell%20a%20hundred%20writers%20one%20cup%20of%20coffee%2C%20since%20the%20hundred-cup%20man%20is%20almost%20certain%20to%20return%20for%20the%20next%20hundred%2C%20and%20the%20hundred%20after%20that.%20Recent%20scholarship%20has%20made%20the%20case%20that%20repeat%20business%20is%20worth%20much%20more%20to%20a%20small%20enterprise%20than%20new%20business%2C%20given%20the%20stability%20of%20%E2%80%9Crecurring%20revenue.%E2%80%9D%20The%20one%20proviso%20would%20seem%20to%20be%20that%20there%20has%20to%20be%20enough%20room%20for%20new%20customers%20to%20find%20a%20place.%20The%20caf%C3%A9%20can%E2%80%99t%20become%20too%20exclusive%20a%20club%20and%20remain%20profitable.%20This%20may%20be%20why%20the%20adjective%20regularly%20applied%20to%20the%20caf%C3%A9%20is%20%E2%80%9Cgrand%2C%E2%80%9D%20or%20why%20so%20many%20caf%C3%A9s%20in%20Europe%20were%20exceptionally%20large%20spaces%2C%20even%20if%2C%20to%20judge%20by%20contemporary%20drawings%20and%20photographs%2C%20they%20were%20seldom%20close%20to%20being%20fully%20occupied.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20one%20of%20the%20greatest%20of%20caf%C3%A9%20comedies%2C%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fcharlie-chaplin%5C%22%3ECharlie%20Chaplin%3C%2Fa%3E%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FImmigrant-Charles-Chaplin%2Fdp%2FB07JWJTZ1J%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1545058342%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-2%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DThe%2BImmigrant%2Bchaplin%5C%22%3EThe%20Immigrant%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20tramp%2C%20newly%20arrived%20in%20America%20from%20an%20unnamed%20but%20clearly%20Eastern%20European%20place%20of%20origin%2C%20tries%20to%20put%20off%20the%20arrival%20of%20a%20check%20he%20can%E2%80%99t%20foot%20simply%20by%20ordering%20more%20coffee.%20And%20it%20mattered%20that%20what%20caf%C3%A9%20habitu%C3%A9s%20were%20habituated%20to%20was%20drinking%20coffee.%20Pinsker%20is%20oddly%20reticent%20about%20how%20the%20coffee%20was%20made%20and%20dispensed.%20For%20coffee%20is%20in%20itself%20a%20kind%20of%20wonder%20drug%E2%80%94a%20stimulant%20that%20seems%20to%20ease%20attention-based%20tasks.%20The%20shape%20and%20meaning%20of%20a%20caf%C3%A9%20surely%20has%20much%20to%20do%20with%20the%20connection%20between%20coffee%20and%20social%20stimulation.%20Indeed%2C%20one%20of%20the%20historical%20functions%20of%20coffee%20was%20to%20not%20be%20alcohol.%20European%20cultures%20that%20had%20always%20drunk%20beer%20instead%20of%20unsafe%20water%20were%20liberated%20from%20their%20own%20stupor%20by%20the%20rise%20of%20caffeinated%20brews.%20The%20caf%C3%A9s%20were%20training%20playgrounds%20in%20attentiveness.%20They%20made%20the%20town%20alert.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Pinsker, lovingly attentive to the habitués of his cafés, leaves the economics of the cafés quite shadowy. The rule, still in place in much of Europe, was that you need buy only a cup of coffee to occupy a seat indefinitely. Customer loyalty is the commercial principle here. Better to sell the same writer a hundred cups of coffee than to sell a hundred writers one cup of coffee, since the hundred-cup man is almost certain to return for the next hundred, and the hundred after that. Recent scholarship has made the case that repeat business is worth much more to a small enterprise than new business, given the stability of “recurring revenue.” The one proviso would seem to be that there has to be enough room for new customers to find a place. The café can’t become too exclusive a club and remain profitable. This may be why the adjective regularly applied to the café is “grand,” or why so many cafés in Europe were exceptionally large spaces, even if, to judge by contemporary drawings and photographs, they were seldom close to being fully occupied."],["p","In one of the greatest of café comedies, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/charlie-chaplin"},"Charlie Chaplin"],"’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Immigrant-Charles-Chaplin/dp/B07JWJTZ1J/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545058342&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=The+Immigrant+chaplin"},"The Immigrant"],",” the tramp, newly arrived in America from an unnamed but clearly Eastern European place of origin, tries to put off the arrival of a check he can’t foot simply by ordering more coffee. And it mattered that what café habitués were habituated to was drinking coffee. Pinsker is oddly reticent about how the coffee was made and dispensed. For coffee is in itself a kind of wonder drug—a stimulant that seems to ease attention-based tasks. The shape and meaning of a café surely has much to do with the connection between coffee and social stimulation. Indeed, one of the historical functions of coffee was to not be alcohol. European cultures that had always drunk beer instead of unsafe water were liberated from their own stupor by the rise of caffeinated brews. The cafés were training playgrounds in attentiveness.

Certainly the café could be the foundation of emancipated life—that was why Agnon’s generation rushed there so ardently. But the study reveals a paradox of some poignancy: no matter how elaborately articulated, no matter how high its ceilings and how dignified its servers, civil society can’t protect cosmopolitan communities from assault when it happens. The café may have been a foundation, but it could never be a fortress. The most heartbreaking scenes in Pinsker’s book are from Warsaw, where much loved ghetto institutions like Café Sztuka stayed in business right up to the final expulsion of the Jews to Treblinka, in 1943. Singers sang and dancers danced, with the forbearance of easily bribed Germans, and while many condemned the frivolity (and the implicit collaboration with the Germans) of these last cafés, the writer Michel Mazor rightly praised their “continuous existence in a city which the Germans regarded as a cemetery—was it not, in a certain sense, the ghetto’s protest, its affirmation of the right to live?”"],["p","Pinsker ends his book with a melancholy account of a couple on the Lower East Side of Manhattan who attempted to open a classic Central European-style café a decade or so ago and failed. The rent was too high, the clientele too restless. Still, the streets of every American city these days are littered with coffee shops that attract hordes of laptop-equipped patrons aspiring to fill them for as much of the day as possible. The standard thing to say, in differentiating our post-Starbucks civilization from the vanished café civilization, is that, where in the classic cafés the point was to interact with your fellows, the point of spending a day working in a Starbucks, or in its cuter and more local-seeming rivals, is ",["em","never"]," to interact with your fellows. Spending the day online, one may be in touch with friends and advocates and lovers, but they exist outside in the ether, not inside the coffee shop. We aren’t sharing space in a modern coffee shop; we’re simply renting it."],["p","Yet all those lonely and alienated Jewish writers were elsewhere, too—lost in books and newspapers, which were the true pastime of the café. What matters is not the words of the person at the next table but the feeling of nearness—the sense of being able to carve out an identity among other identities, of being potentially private in a public space and casually public even while lost in private reveries. Those subtle habits of coexistence are taught by the simultaneous clack of keyboards in a glass-front espresso chain as much as by the jostling of elbows in Warsaw as the pages of the ",["em","Literarishe Bleter"]," were turned. Mere silent proximity of social kinds seems an ignoble and inadequate social ideal.

2010, Daniel Stiepleman attended the funeral of his uncle Martin Ginsburg, a tax attorney. In one of the eulogies, a family friend told the story of Charles E. Moritz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, from 1972, the only case that Ginsburg argued alongside his wife. Their client was an unmarried salesman taking care of his elderly mother, but the tax code prohibited him from deducting caregiving expenses, because he was a man. The attorneys, working with the A.C.L.U., thought that a male plaintiff would be the perfect vehicle for a gender-discrimination case. They were right: the Tenth Circuit ruled in their favor. “I thought, Wow, that would be a great movie,” Stiepleman said recently. After sitting on the idea for more than a year, he asked his aunt for her blessing to write a screenplay. “Well,” she said, skeptically, “if that’s how you think you’d like to spend your time.”"],["p","It was well worth his time, because Stiepleman’s aunt is ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ruth-bader-ginsburg"},"Ruth Bader Ginsburg"],". In other words, he won the aunt lottery. The movie, “On the Basis of Sex,” which opens on Christmas Day, stars Armie Hammer as Martin and Felicity Jones as Ruth. “I think we do her a disservice when we turn her into a superhero,” Stiepleman, thirty-seven, said in his Upper West Side apartment. Growing up, on Long Island, he found his aunt “intimidating,” he said, “because you talk to her and there’s always a long silence. It took me a while to figure out that that was how she communicated.” Every Thanksgiving from when he was five to twelve, she would give him a copy of the U.S. Constitution for Hanukkah. “In my twenties, I thought, Aha! She’s teaching me something very important about patriotism and law. Now I’m in my thirties and have kids of my own, and I realize, No, she just gets a discount at the Supreme Court gift shop.”"],["p","Much of the film centers on Ruth and Martin’s marriage, which Stiepleman came to see as a model for his own. “They were equal partners at home,” he said. “Marty did all the cooking, because Ruth was terrible at it.” (A cookbook, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Chef-Supreme-Ginsburg-Justices-Memoriam/dp/B00FIE0LL6"},"Chef Supreme: Martin Ginsburg,"],"” was published posthumously, and the film features his acclaimed chicken-liver pâté, and also Ruth’s “inedible” 1956 casserole.) Stiepleman recalled a holiday party during his childhood at which Martin served a delicious chocolate-mousse cake. A grownup asked Stiepleman what he wanted to be when he grew up. “I said, ‘I want to be like Uncle Martin,’ and the person said, ‘Oh, you want to be a lawyer?’ And I said, ‘No, I’m going to be a cooking dad!’&nbsp;”"],["p","Now that Stiepleman is a cooking dad—his wife is an oncology fellow at Columbia, and they have two young children—he had decided to re-create the chocolate-mousse cake for a kindergarten potluck. Stiepleman, barefoot in his kitchen, preheated the oven and buttered the inside of a Bundt pan. His brother had texted him the recipe, which read like a gregarious tax lawyer had written it. (“Amply feeds 8 and can be stretched to 12 persons.”) “Whenever I couldn’t find Uncle Martin on the page, I would just go and read his cookbook,” he said."],["p","As he wrote the screenplay, Stiepleman made several trips to Washington, D.C., where his aunt granted him access to her files at the Library of Congress. “Then, by night, we would sit together and have dinner and usually polish off a bottle of wine,” he recalled. ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/08/ruth-bader-ginsburgs-unlikely-path-to-the-supreme-court"},"Aunt Ruth"]," gave detailed notes on his drafts. “I’d call her up, and she’d be, like, ‘Oh, Daniel, I’m in the middle of reading the Affordable Care Act. Can you call me back in twenty minutes?’ And then she’d be, like, ‘O.K., page 1,’ and she’d go through it like a contract. ‘Here you have me wearing high heels at Harvard, but in those days I used to walk to school, so I wouldn’t wear high heels.’&nbsp;” After she saw the film for the first time, she told her nephew, “I just love that it’s joyous.”"],["p","Stiepleman placed the chocolate batter in the oven. (Uncle Martin suggests serving the cake in thin slices.) He had spoken to his aunt two days earlier, not long after a fall had caused her to fracture three ribs and had given liberal America a panic attack. “She said, ‘I’m going back to work tomorrow.’ I said, ‘Will you get some sleep first?’&nbsp;” Stiepleman opened his wedding album, from 2007, which had photos of Aunt Ruth officiating in her robe and lace collar. Her speech included the line “by the authority vested in me by the Constitution.” “That gets a laugh every time,” Stiepleman said. “It’s like you need an act of Congress if you want to get divorced.”&nbsp;♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59113a7276b9ca4b4bbd158c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59113a7276b9ca4b4bbd158c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Pictures","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-pictures"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Pictures","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-pictures"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":";","url":"/tag/"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Michael Schulman","type":"author","title":"Michael Schulman has contributed to The New Yorker since 2006.

Trump said some time ago that he believes his personal finances should be off limits to investigators. In an interview with the ",["em","Times"]," in July, 2017, he asserted that if Robert Mueller, the special counsel, sought to investigate the Trump family’s business dealings he would be crossing a “red line.” When, later that year, several news reports suggested that Mueller had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records relating to Trump’s businesses, the President reportedly told members of his staff that he wanted to fire Mueller in response. It was never confirmed whether Mueller had actually subpoenaed Deutsche Bank, but the President’s aversion to the scrutiny of his business interests caught the attention of Representative Adam Schiff, who will become the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence next year. On a recent weekend, at a busy restaurant in downtown Burbank, in the heart of his congressional district, Schiff talked about his plans for conducting an investigation that will be parallel to Mueller’s, probing Trump’s connections to Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other places around the world. As Schiff described his approach, it became clear that he wasn’t just planning to cross Trump’s red line—he intended to obliterate it."],["p","“Our role is not the same as Bob Mueller’s,” Schiff told me, over a vegan burger. (He changed his eating habits a few years ago, in order to lower his cholesterol.) The job of prosecutors like Mueller is to identify and prosecute crimes, not necessarily to inform and educate the public. Congressional committees, like the one Schiff will soon lead, are supposed to monitor the executive branch and expose wrongdoing. Mueller is supposed to file a report on his findings, but, in keeping with the regulations for the office of the special counsel, it will be up to his supervisor in the Justice Department, who is now Matthew Whitaker, the acting Attorney General, to determine whether Mueller’s report is made public. Schiff has his own agenda for areas to investigate. “The one that has always concerned me is the financial issues, which obviously have come much to the fore this week,” he said. Shortly before Schiff and I spoke, Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, had pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his role in the negotiations for building a Trump tower in Moscow. Cohen had said earlier that these discussions ended in January, 2016, but he admitted in court that he had been negotiating with Russian officials, and keeping Trump apprised, through the first half of 2016, during the Republican Presidential primaries. Trump has denied that he was doing business with the Russians during this period."],["p","Schiff went on, “At the end of the day, what should concern us most is anything that can have a continuing impact on the foreign policy and national-security policy of the United States, and, if the Russians were laundering money for the Trump Organization, that would be totally compromising.” Schiff hypothesizes that Trump went beyond using his campaign and the Presidency as a vehicle for advancing his business interests, speculating that he may have shaped policy with an eye to expanding his fortune. “There’s a whole constellation of issues where that is essentially the center of gravity,” Schiff said. “Obviously, that issue is implicated in efforts to build Trump Tower in Moscow. It’s implicated in the money that Trump is bragging he was getting from the Saudis. And why shouldn’t he love the Saudis? He said he was making so much money from them.” As the Washington ",["em","Post"]," has reported, Trump has sold a hotel to a Saudi prince, a $4.5-million apartment near the United Nations to the Saudi government, and many other apartments to Saudi nationals, and, since Trump became President, his hotels in New York and Chicago have seen significant increases in bookings from Saudi visitors. In a break with the Republican congressional leadership, Trump refuses to take action against Saudi Arabia, notwithstanding substantial evidence that Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince and the putative head of state, directed the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who lived in the United States."],["p","Schiff also pointed out that Jared Kushner, the President’s son-in-law, met with the C.E.O. of a state-owned Russian bank in December, 2016, and that, the following month, Erik Prince, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign, met with the leader of a Russian sovereign-wealth fund in the Seychelles, an East African archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean. “The American people have a right to know that their President is working on their behalf, not his family’s financial interests,” Schiff said. “Right now, I don’t think any of us can have the confidence that that’s the case.” All of these subjects, Schiff averred, were fair game for investigation by the committee that he will soon chair."],["p","As the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, Schiff has directed a staff of eleven. As the chairman, he will direct twenty-five, some of whom will be devoted to the Russia investigation. “We’ve been deluged with résumés,” Schiff said. It is now clear that during the campaign, when Trump was advocating the removal of sanctions on Russia, he was privately trying to make money in Moscow in a deal that may have required Putin’s help. Schiff wants to know: “Is that why Trump is so pro-Russian? Is his financial interest guiding his foreign policy?” Schiff thinks the answer to those questions may be found in the records of Deutsche Bank, which has been fined hundreds of millions of dollars for laundering money for Russia, and was reportedly the only bank willing to do business with Trump in the nineteen-nineties, when major Wall Street firms declined to loan him money after a series of failed business ventures. “We are going to be looking at the issue of possible money laundering by the Trump Organization, and Deutsche Bank is one obvious place to start,” Schiff added."],["p","Since the beginning of the Trump Administration, Schiff has been a ubiquitous presence on television, speaking about matters related to the Russia investigation. “The voice that Adam gives to these issues is one that is calming, logical, linear, measured but forceful,” Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader and likely the new Speaker of the House, told me. “I have complete confidence in him to be very strategic in how he returns the Intelligence Committee to a bipartisan arena, without doing what Devin Nunes did as chairman of the committee, which I thought bordered on the criminal.” The government watchdog Campaign for Accountability has filed complaints against Nunes for leaking confidential information from the ongoing Russia investigation. (Nunes’s office denies these accusations as “discredited fake news stories.”)"],["p","Schiff repeatedly chastised the Republicans on his committee, led by Nunes, for their refusal to conduct a thorough investigation into Trump’s possible misdeeds, and he defended Mueller’s efforts to impose some accountability for the issues that fall within the special counsel’s purview. With the Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives, Schiff’s responsibilities as chair of the committee will present both great opportunities and significant peril. Schiff will no longer be able to blame the Republicans for wasting time. It’s his investigation now, and he’s planning to heed the advice, familiar to viewers of the movie version of “All the President’s Men,” to “follow the

few years after Schiff was first elected to the House, in 2000, he and his wife, Eve, who had been living in his district in California, enrolled their two children in school in the Washington suburbs, so that Schiff could spend more time with his family. Since then, he has spent every other weekend in his district, which includes Hollywood and parts of the San Fernando Valley. On a recent Sunday, he spoke at a church service commemorating World ",["em",{"class":"small"},"AIDS"]," Day, lit a Christmas tree at a street festival, and viewed an exhibit at the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust, where the tour guide told him that a new documentary about the Sobibór concentration camp was “getting Oscar buzz.” Schiff then went to light the candles on an oversized menorah in front of a Mr. Luggage store at a mall in Burbank, where a man named David Nathan Schwartz introduced himself. They discovered that they had been in the same third-grade class, in Framingham, Massachusetts. Later, recalling third grade, Schiff told me, “That was the last time that someone called me Adam Shit. I think the kid’s mother actually washed his mouth out with soap.”"],["p","He was referring to an incident last month, when the President tweeted, “So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!” (In fact, there is no requirement for Mueller, who was named to his post by Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, to be confirmed by the Senate.) Schiff has been a frequent target of Trump, who has called him “sleazy,” a “leaker,” and “little.” Schiff is not especially short or slight, but he does appear diminutive. His expression is often neutral, and his countenance is unaffected by his periodic visits to the California sunshine; he could pass for someone in his late thirties or his early sixties. (He’s fifty-eight.) Schiff’s constituents at Disney, DreamWorks, and Paramount would probably cast him as an accountant. He seems to cultivate this blandness of affect to convey that he deals in facts, eschews drama, and tells the truth. As he often mentions, he spent half a dozen years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, a job that trained him in the presentation of evidence. Schiff told me, “Trump has created a constituency for people who are not running around with their hair on fire.”"],["p","Until March 20, 2017, Schiff’s skills were known to few. Most of the committee’s business is conducted in secret, in a secure suite of offices three floors below the Capitol Visitor Center. But on that day the Intelligence Committee held a rare public hearing, in which James Comey, who, at that point, was still the director of the F.B.I., publicly confirmed for the first time that the Bureau was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Before Comey began to speak, Schiff gave an opening statement in which he clinically—and devastatingly—summarized the existing evidence in the case. “Last summer, at the height of a bitterly contested and hugely consequential Presidential campaign, a foreign, adversarial power intervened in an effort to weaken our democracy, and to influence the outcome for one candidate and against the other,” he said. “That foreign adversary was, of course, Russia, and it acted through its intelligence agencies and upon the direct instructions of its autocratic ruler, Vladimir Putin, in order to help Donald&nbsp;J. Trump become the forty-fifth President of the United States.” Schiff laid out a story that became familiar in the next year and a half: how Trump’s campaign adviser, Carter Page, an eccentric oil-industry consultant, travelled to Russia during the 2016 campaign and gave a speech in which he criticized U.S. policy toward Russia for being too harsh; how Trump’s friend Roger Stone, a longtime political consultant, had advance knowledge of the theft, by Russian interests, of the e-mails of prominent Democrats; how Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman and a noted lobbyist for pro-Russian interests, supervised the Republican Convention, where the Party platform became more sympathetic to Russia. Michael Bahar, who was then Schiff’s top staffer on the committee, recalled, “Schiff kept saying at the time that it’s our job in Congress to educate people about what was really going on. That’s the way he approached his opening statement. He was saying, This is what we need to look at. It was so compelling and so detailed. It quickly became clear that it caused panic for those on the other side.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c12e45f2eb5b760bfa5e8be%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c12e45f2eb5b760bfa5e8be%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c12e45f2eb5b760bfa5e8be%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c12e45f2eb5b760bfa5e8be"}]],["p","What followed, a day later, has passed into Washington lore. Nunes, who represents a district in California’s agricultural San Joaquin Valley, and Schiff had a reasonably productive relationship. As the chair and the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, respectively, before Trump became President, they collaborated on bills to improve cybersecurity and to codify the rules on the collection of metadata by the intelligence agencies. But, after Comey confirmed that there would be an F.B.I. investigation of the 2016 election, Nunes slipped into a highly partisan mode from which he has not yet emerged. (Nunes has declined to comment.) On the night of March 21st, Nunes leaped out of an Uber, in which he had been riding with a staffer, and made his way to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the White House, where he reportedly met with Michael Ellis, a national-security lawyer in the White House Counsel’s Office, and Ezra Cohen-Watnick, then the senior director for intelligence for the National Security Council. (A lawyer for Ezra Cohen-Watnick said that his client “had no knowledge of the meeting.”) The next day, Nunes held a news conference, announcing, breathlessly, that he had received secret information corroborating Trump’s recent claim that President Obama had wiretapped his campaign. Nunes’s story quickly fell apart, however, and his late-night visit to the White House complex, known as “the midnight run,” became the source of much mockery. As a result, Nunes recused himself from his committee’s Russia investigation, although he continued to review related intelligence and later resumed leadership. The incident established the lengths to which Republicans on the committee would go to defend Trump’s behavior. Relations between Democrats and Republicans on the committee never recovered. (Nunes declined to comment, but his spokesperson said, in a statement, “It’s amusing to see the Democrat-media complex continue to recall the false ‘midnight run’ story, which was invented by Schiff’s own staffers, fed by them to Schiff’s worshipful media allies, and debunked publicly by Chairman Nunes himself.”)"],["p","Still, during the following year the committee did bring in fifty-eight witnesses to testify about the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia in 2016, with Schiff usually leading the questioning for the Democrats. The Republicans on the committee largely devoted their efforts to damage control on Trump’s behalf. One critical issue was the meeting at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, when the senior leadership of the Trump campaign, including Kushner, Manafort, and Donald Trump, Jr., met with a lawyer whom they had been told was a representative of the Russian government who had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. According to telephone records available to the committee, three days before the meeting Trump, Jr., made a series of calls. In the interval between one call from Russia and another to Russia on that day, Trump, Jr., spoke for three or four minutes to someone whose phone number was blocked. This raised the question of whether Trump, Jr., had advised his father of the planned meeting—which both the President and his son have long denied. Under Nunes, the committee declined to issue a subpoena to the telephone company to determine whether Trump, Jr., had been talking with his father. Schiff told me that, when he takes over the committee, one of his first orders of business will be to issue such a subpoena."],["p","Notwithstanding the frustrations that Schiff experienced under Nunes’s committee, he did have a chance to show off his prosecutorial skills when questioning witnesses. In late September of this year, the House Intelligence Committee voted to release around fifty transcripts from the committee’s investigation, but, to date, only two transcripts—those of Erik Prince and Carter Page—have been made available. Schiff has promised to expedite the release of the others. Among the interviews to be disclosed is one with Kushner, as well as others with the Trump associates Hope Hicks, Corey Lewandowski, Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, Michael Cohen, and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Page, a foreign-policy adviser to the Trump campaign, who has a Ph.D. from the School of Oriental and African Studies, at the University of London, later tried to minimize his contacts with Russian government officials during his 2016 visit to Russia. During Schiff’s questioning of Page, the congressman referred to a television interview that Page had given. “You stated that you had no meetings, no serious discussions with anyone high up or in any official capacity; it’s just kind of man-in-the-street, you know,” Schiff said. “Was that an accurate description of your trip to Moscow in July of last year?”"],["p","“Absolutely,” Page responded."],["p","Schiff then asked whether Page considered Arkady Dvorkovich, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation at the time, to be a “high-up official or someone in an official capacity.” Page sputtered that he did not “meet with” Dvorkovich: “I greeted him briefly as he was walking off the stage after his speech.”"],["p","Schiff, closing the trap he had laid, pointed to a memo that Page had written to Trump campaign officials, which stated, “In a private conversation, Dvorkovich expressed strong support for Mr. Trump.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ”"],["p","“Dr. Page,” Schiff said, “did you write that?” Page said that he did, asserting, “That’s all he expressed in that brief hello.” Schiff zeroed in: “Two minutes ago, you said you had no private meeting with Arkady. Is that correct?”"],["p","“Yes,” Page said."],["p","“And now you say you did have a private conversation with him on the subject of U.S.-Russia relations. Is that correct?” Page struggled to change the subject."],["p","The partisan donnybrook in the Intelligence Committee continued through April, 2018, when the Republicans and the Democrats released separate final reports. Nunes and the other Republicans concluded that the “committee found no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated, or conspired with the Russian government.” Schiff and the Democrats wrote, “The Majority’s report reflects a lack of seriousness and interest in pursuing the truth. By refusing to call in key witnesses, by refusing to request pertinent documents, and by refusing to compel and enforce witness cooperation and answers to key questions, the Majority hobbled the Committee’s ability to conduct a credible investigation that could inspire public confidence.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOddly%2C%20the%20first%20turning%20point%20in%20Schiff%E2%80%99s%20career%20also%20involved%20an%20investigation%20that%20initially%20ended%20in%20frustration%2C%20and%20that%20also%20concerned%20an%20employee%20of%20the%20federal%20government%20who%20betrayed%20his%20country%20to%20Russia%20(then%20the%20Soviet%20Union).%20Richard%20Miller%2C%20the%20first%20F.B.I.%20agent%20to%20be%20prosecuted%20for%20espionage%20against%20the%20United%20States%2C%20was%20arrested%20in%20Los%20Angeles%20on%20October%203%2C%201984%2C%20along%20with%20a%20Russian%20%C3%A9migr%C3%A9%20couple%20named%20Svetlana%20and%20Nikolai%20Ogorodnikov%2C%20who%20were%2C%20it%20emerged%2C%20sleeper%20K.G.B.%20agents%20assigned%20to%20the%20United%20States.%20Miller%2C%20who%20had%20eight%20children%20and%20was%20burdened%20with%20financial%20problems%2C%20was%20involved%20in%20an%20extramarital%20affair%20with%20Svetlana%20and%2C%20it%20was%20alleged%2C%20passed%20her%20an%20F.B.I.%20counterintelligence%20manual%20and%20other%20classified%20documents%20in%20return%20for%20a%20promise%20of%20fifty%20thousand%20dollars%20in%20cash%20and%20fifteen%20thousand%20dollars%20in%20gold.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ERobert%20Bonner%2C%20then%20the%20U.S.%20Attorney%20in%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20tried%20the%20case%20himself.%20Miller%E2%80%99s%20first%20trial%20ended%20in%20a%20hung%20jury.%20Bonner%20won%20a%20conviction%20in%20the%20retrial%2C%20but%20that%20verdict%20was%20overturned%20by%20an%20appeals%20court%2C%20on%20the%20ground%20that%20evidence%20relating%20to%20a%20polygraph%20test%20had%20been%20improperly%20admitted%20against%20Miller.%20Bonner%2C%20who%20had%20been%20nominated%20for%20a%20federal%20judgeship%2C%20assigned%20the%20case%20to%20Schiff%2C%20who%20had%20just%20turned%20thirty%2C%20to%20try%20it%20for%20a%20third%20time.%20%E2%80%9CI%20had%20total%20faith%20and%20trust%20in%20him%2C%20or%20I%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20have%20assigned%20such%20a%20high-profile%20case%20to%20him%2C%E2%80%9D%20Bonner%20told%20me.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAt%20the%20time%2C%20Schiff%E2%80%99s%20ambitions%20were%20beginning%20to%20take%20shape.%20Born%20in%201960%2C%20Schiff%20spent%20his%20early%20childhood%20in%20suburban%20Boston%2C%20where%20his%20father%20was%20in%20the%20garment%20business%2C%20working%20for%20the%20company%20that%20sold%20slacks%20made%20by%20the%20American%20menswear%20designer%20Farah.%20(He%20is%20not%20related%20to%20the%20Schiff%20family%20that%20used%20to%20own%20the%20New%20York%20%3Cem%3EPost%3C%2Fem%3E.)%20When%20Schiff%20was%20eleven%2C%20the%20family%20moved%20to%20Northern%20California%2C%20where%20his%20father%20started%20a%20construction%20business%2C%20focussed%20on%20making%20gunite%2C%20which%20is%20used%20in%20the%20building%20of%20swimming%20pools.%20After%20college%2C%20at%20Stanford%2C%20Schiff%20went%20to%20Harvard%20Law%20School%2C%20from%20which%20he%20graduated%20in%201985.%20%E2%80%9CNothing%20like%20spending%20your%20summers%20shovelling%20gunite%20to%20convince%20you%20to%20go%20to%20law%20school%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20told%20me.%20After%20a%20brief%20stint%20at%20a%20law%20firm%2C%20he%20joined%20the%20U.S.%20Attorney%E2%80%99s%20office%20in%201987.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESchiff%20won%20the%20Miller%20case%2C%20the%20judge%20having%20rejected%20Miller%E2%80%99s%20defense%20that%20he%20was%20actually%20recruiting%20the%20Ogorodnikovs%20as%20American%20spies.%20Schiff%20recalled%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20must%20have%20dealt%20with%20a%20hundred%20F.B.I.%20agents%20over%20the%20course%20of%20that%20case%E2%80%94between%20witnesses%20and%20investigators%E2%80%94and%20it%20gave%20me%20an%20incredible%20respect%20for%20the%20work%20that%20they%20do.%E2%80%9D%20That%20experience%20led%20him%20to%20respond%20with%20an%20extra%20measure%20of%20disbelief%20when%2C%20later%2C%20Nunes%20and%20Trump%20posited%20that%20the%20President%20was%20the%20victim%20of%20an%20F.B.I.%20conspiracy%20to%20frame%20him%20for%20misdeeds%20connected%20to%20Russia.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESoon%20afterward%2C%20Schiff%20decided%20to%20run%20for%20an%20open%20seat%20in%20the%20California%20State%20Assembly.%20He%20was%2C%20by%20his%20own%20admission%2C%20a%20pretty%20awful%20candidate%E2%80%94awkward%2C%20pompous%2C%20long-winded%2C%20and%20lacking%20a%20gift%20for%20the%20sound%20bite%2C%20which%20has%20since%20leavened%20his%20geeky%20public%20persona.%20%E2%80%9CI%20thought%20it%20was%20demeaning%20to%20have%20to%20answer%20questions%20on%20serious%20issues%20in%20thirty%20seconds%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20told%20me%2C%20and%20added%2C%20%E2%80%9CNow%20I%20know%20you%20have%20to%20do%20it%20in%20a%20tweet.%E2%80%9D%20His%20friend%20Brian%20Hennigan%2C%20a%20colleague%20at%20the%20U.S.%20Attorney%E2%80%99s%20office%2C%20recalled%20Schiff%E2%80%99s%20early%20fund-raisers.%20%E2%80%9CYou%20could%20see%20that%20the%20longer%20he%20talked%20the%20more%20people%20pu

Schiff recalled, “I must have dealt with a hundred F.B.I. agents over the course of that case—between witnesses and investigators—and it gave me an incredible respect for the work that they do.” That experience led him to respond with an extra measure of disbelief when, later, Nunes and Trump posited that the President was the victim of an F.B.I. conspiracy to frame him for misdeeds connected to Russia."],["p","Soon afterward, Schiff decided to run for an open seat in the California State Assembly. He was, by his own admission, a pretty awful candidate—awkward, pompous, long-winded, and lacking a gift for the sound bite, which has since leavened his geeky public persona. “I thought it was demeaning to have to answer questions on serious issues in thirty seconds,” he told me, and added, “Now I know you have to do it in a tweet.” His friend Brian Hennigan, a colleague at the U.S. Attorney’s office, recalled Schiff’s early fund-raisers. “You could see that the longer he talked the more people put their checkbooks away,” he said. In that race, Schiff finished tenth in a fourteen-person field. Determined, he resolved to improve as a candidate so that his next run for elective office might turn out better. Parke Skelton, a California political consultant whom Schiff hired after his initial defeat, said, “Adam really, really wanted a career in politics, and he wanted to know what to do, and we saw that there were too many rising Democrats in Venice, where he was living at the time. So we looked for a place that was Republican but trending Democratic, so there wouldn’t be too many people ahead of him. We settled on Burbank.”"],["p","There, in 1994, a young Republican named James Rogan had just been elected to the State Assembly, and Schiff ran against him. In November, Schiff lost that race, too, but he showed more promise, and two years later he was recruited to run for a seat in the California State Senate, which he won. By then, Rogan had been elected to Congress, and in 1998 he became a leader in the fight to impeach Bill Clinton. When Clinton went on trial in the Senate, Rogan was one of the House managers leading the charge—a role that earned him some powerful enemies back home in California, including David Geffen, the media mogul. Geffen resolved to help raise money for a Democrat who was willing to challenge Rogan, and he and others decided on Schiff as the best option. The contest became the marquee congressional race of 2000, and, with more than eleven million dollars spent between the two campaigns, it was, at the time, the most expensive House race ever conducted."],["p","During that campaign, Schiff became a favorite of Pelosi, also a Californian, who was working her way up the Democratic leadership in the House. “When we started, our delegation in the House was split almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans, and that’s when we told the national Democrats in Washington to leave us alone and let us do our transformation, and Adam was a big part of that,” Pelosi told me. She said that, in the past year, as she advised Democratic candidates, she often cited Schiff’s first race. “Adam ran that whole campaign against a person who was a prosecutor against Clinton without ever mentioning impeachment,” Pelosi said. “So today, when we had this election, Adam’s is my poster story. I told them, ‘Don’t talk about Trump, don’t talk about impeachment, talk about kitchen-table issues.’&nbsp;” Schiff won by nine points in 2000, and in his nine subsequent races he hasn’t faced a competitive challenge. Rogan is now a state-court judge in California. In 2019, the California delegation in the House will consist of forty-six Democrats and seven

It was a sobering experience. “The economic dislocation from the arrival of capitalism created a real sense of aggrievement on the part of people whose skills were not valued in the new economy,” he told me. “It created a wave of xenophobic populism not unlike what we’re seeing around the world and here today.” While Schiff was on the assignment, the Czech Republic and Slovakia split into two countries."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c12e45e9de2df36eb57f296%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c12e45e9de2df36eb57f296%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c12e45e9de2df36eb57f296%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c12e45e9de2df36eb57f296"}]],["p","His time there informed his congressional career. “Adam and I were both first elected in 2000, and we went to orientation together,” Steve Israel, who represented a district on Long Island and parts of Queens until 2017, when he retired to write novels, said. “They told us there were three kinds of members of Congress—the ‘pothole member,’ who concentrates on district issues, the ‘political member,’ who works on moving up the ladder, and the ‘policy member,’ who digs down in specific policy areas and becomes the expert on the floor of the House on those particular policies. Adam was always regarded as a policy guy. We started a ‘nerd caucus,’ because we wanted more detailed information on foreign policy, and started bringing in outside speakers. But the thing about Adam is that, while he is a policy guy, he has also grown into being the other two kinds of member as well. He’s become a political force, and they love him in his district, too.” Schiff’s district includes the city of Glendale, which has a large Armenian-American population, and he’s become outspoken in support of recognition and commemoration of the Armenian genocide that took place in the early twentieth century."],["p","Schiff’s roots in the “nerd caucus,” and his days in Slovakia, figure in his plans for the Intelligence Committee. “One of the first open hearings that we’re going to have is on the rise of authoritarianism around the world,” he told me. Russia, he said, “has been interfering in elections for a long time in Europe and elsewhere, and it’s not just what Russia is doing. There is a global rise of autocracy that ought to concern every American. This is the new ideological struggle that we’re in.” Schiff cited Martin Luther King, Jr., who, paraphrasing the abolitionist cleric Theodore Parker, said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” Schiff said, “There’s nothing inexorable about this. We are at an inflection point where we cannot say that next year more people are going to live in a free society.”"],["p","As Schiff sees it, Trump is pushing the country in precisely the wrong direction, at a pivotal moment. “Normally, America would rise to this challenge,” he said. “We would be championing democracy and human rights. But we have a President who’s very fond of ties with the autocrats, who disdains our fellow-democracies, and he is just adding kindling to this global trend. There is a constituency with the same kind of xenophobic populism that you see in Europe, in South America, and elsewhere, and Trump tapped into that, but he has certainly made that trend so much worse and more pronounced.” He went on, “It’s not just that autocrats are winning in places like Brazil. The far-right parties in places like Germany and Austria are growing. He is undermining people like Merkel and Macron and others who are resisting that.”"],["p","A few years ago, Schiff became a friend of the late John McCain, whom he accompanied to a couple of international conferences. Once, in Munich, McCain invited Schiff to tag along to a dinner with the singer Bono and Bill Gates—“Not my usual crowd,” Schiff said, with a laugh. “At the dinner, we’re telling jokes, and Bono tells a joke about being Irish. And then he gets very serious and he says, ‘You know, I love Ireland, I’m a proud Irishman. Ireland is a great country, but it’s not an idea. America is not just a country; it’s an idea.’ And I realized, when he said it, that what’s really at risk right now is the whole idea of America. People around the world are questioning what we stand for. Maybe we’re not the country that they thought we were. And, as long as they don’t recognize what they see in the Oval Office, there’s a big responsibility on the members of Congress to speak those values, the way John McCain did.”"],["p","Still, Schiff knows that his legacy, to say nothing of his political future, will be defined by his handling of the Russia investigation. The challenge he faces has made him a national figure, and his harsh view of Trump has set the tone for many other Democrats to follow. At times, he may already have gone too far. After Michael Cohen pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to facilitating unlawful contributions to Trump’s campaign, specifically the payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, Trump’s alleged former paramours, Schiff said, on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” that the President “faces the real prospect of jail time” for his role in the case. Schiff told me, “The prosecutors said that Cohen deserved jail time because he helped conceal payments to women that, if they had been disclosed as they should have been, might have changed the outcome of the election. But that argument applies with even more force to Trump himself, because he was the guy directing the scheme, and the beneficiary of it. No jail time for him would be a terrible double standard.” (Last week, Cohen was sentenced to thirty-six months for his crimes.)"],["p","Calling for the President to be incarcerated when he hasn’t yet even been charged, or the evidence against him fully revealed, is, at the very least, premature, and perhaps irresponsible. Henry Waxman, a longtime congressman from a Los Angeles district before his recent retirement, conducted several successful investigations and has been a mentor of Schiff’s. “Adam has done a superb job this last year,” he said. “He achieved just the right tone in his public statements.” But, Waxman added, Schiff now has a very different task ahead of him, and cautioned, “Don’t make wild accusations and then try to substantiate them. You start with the facts and stay with the facts, and lead them to drawing a conclusion. In terms of congressional investigations, don’t get ahead of the facts. Make them public and let people examine those facts and make their own conclusions.”"],["p","Turf fights, too, may be in Schiff’s future. Other House committees, including Judiciary (chaired by Jerrold Nadler, of New York) and Oversight (chaired by Elijah Cummings, of Maryland), have overlapping jurisdiction when it comes to investigations of the White House, and they will want to mount their own hearings. The prospect of too many investigations runs the risk of a backlash against the Democrats, as Pelosi herself acknowledges. “There is joint jurisdiction among the committees, and we will have to collaborate,” she told me. “We have to be careful in how we proceed. It’s all about priorities. What I have always said is you have to make your best case. You can’t make every case.” The coveted testimony of Michael Cohen is an example of this complexity. Schiff’s office has already been in touch with Cohen’s attorneys about possible testimony concerning his dealings with Russia on Trump’s behalf. Schiff told me that he recognized that the subject of Cohen’s unlawful campaign contributions might fall under the ambit of another committee. Pelosi will bear the ultimate responsibility for sorting out the range and order of Cohen’s testimony amid the contending congressional priorities and egos."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ESchiff%20spent%20the%20run-up%20to%20the%20midterms%20travelling%20around%20the%20country%20campaigning%20to%20elect%20other%20Democrats%20to%20Congress.%20He%20went%20to%20twenty-five%20states%20and%20raised%20or%20contributed%20six%20and%20a%20half%20million%20dollars%20for%20other%20candidates%E2%80%94one%20of%20the%20highest%20totals%20for%20any%20Democrat%20outside%20the%20congressional%20leadership.%20Notably%2C%20his%20travels%20took%20him%20to%20Iowa%2C%20New%20Hampshire%2C%20and%20South%20Carolina%2C%20which%20are%20early%20Presidential%20primary%20states.%20(In%202020%2C%20Schiff%E2%80%99s%20home%20state%20of%20California%20will%20be%2C%20too.)%20California%E2%80%99s%20two%20Senate%20seats%20are%20occupied%20by%20Democrats%2C%20and%20he%20faces%20a%20crowded%20field%20if%20he%20wants%20to%20move%20up%20in%20the%20ranks%20of%20the%20Democratic%20leadership%20in%20the%20House.%20A%20Cabinet%20post%20in%20a%20Democratic%20Administration%20would%20be%20another%20possibility.%20Schiff%E2%80%99s%20travels%20led%20some%20to%20speculate%20that%20he%20may%20be%20considering%20a%20long-shot%20bid%20for%20President%20in%202020.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20flattering%20to%20be%20asked%20the%20question%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20hard%20for%20me%20to%20look%20beyond%20the%20big%20job%20I%20have%20on%20my%20plate%20right%20now%2C%20which%20is%20to%20oversee%20the%20intelligence%20agencies%20and%20do%20a%20thorough%20investigation%20and%20see%20if%20the%20President%20was%20compromised.%20I%20would%20never%20say%20never.%20I%20can%E2%80%99t%20see%20past%20the%20job%20I%20have%20to%20do%20right%20now.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EFor%20the%20moment%2C%20the%20election%20results%20in%20the%20midterms%20gave%20Democrats%20in%20the%20House%20a%20sense%20of%20relief%20that%20borders%2C%20for%20some%2C%20on%20giddiness.%20Even%20Schiff%20seems%20jolly%20these%20days.%20With%20the%20move%20into%20the%20majority%2C%20his%20staff%20has%20more%20work%2C%20but%20also%20more%20room%20to%20breathe.%20Schiff%E2%80%99s%20elevated%20seniority%20has%20allowed%20his%20team%20to%20relocate%20to%20more%20commodious%20offices%2C%20which%20Schiff%20inherited%20from%20Darrell%20Issa%2C%20one%20of%20the%20many%20California%20Republicans%20whose%20congressional%20careers%20ended%20in%202018.%20Schiff%20mostly%20sticks%20to%20business%20with%20his%20staffers%2C%20but%20they%20all%20know%20that%20he%20was%20a%20movie%20buff%20long%20before%20he%20became%20the%20congressman%20from%20Hollywood.%20(Several%20years%20ago%2C%20his%20holiday%20gift%20to%20each%20staffer%20was%20a%20DVD%20of%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Big%20Lebowski%2C%E2%80%9D%20which%20Schiff%20often%20quotes.)%20It%E2%80%99s%20less%20known%20that%2C%20like%20many%20lawyers%20in%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20Schiff%20has%20been%20writing%20screenplays%20on%20the%20side%20for%20years%2C%20which%20together%20amount%20to%20a%20kind%20of%20autobiography.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20first%20was%20a%20post-Holocaust%20story%20called%20%E2%80%98Remnant.%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%20As%20Schiff%20recalled%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20had%20an%20agent%20at%20William%20Morris%20tell%20me%20it%20was%20good%20but%20no%20one%20would%20want%20to%20see%20it%E2%80%94too%20depressing.%20Then%20%E2%80%98Schindler%E2%80%99s%20List%E2%80%99%20came%20out%2C%20and%20I%20was%2C%20like%2C%20%E2%80%98Come%20on!%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%20His%20next%2C%20written%20when%20he%20was%20a%20prosecutor%2C%20was%20a%20murder%20mystery%20called%20%E2%80%9CMinotaur.%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9CI%20had%20a%20friend%20who%20was%20a%20producer%2C%20and%20he%20said%20there%20were%20two%20answers%20in%20Hollywood%E2%80%94%E2%80%98Yes%2C%E2%80%99%20and%20%E2%80%98Here%E2%80%99s%20a%20check.%E2%80%99%20I%20was%20getting%20lots%20of%20yeses.%E2%80%9D%20But%20perhaps%20there%20is%20hope%20for%20his%20third.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20a%20spy%20drama%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CThat%20one%20is%20a%20work%20in%20progress.%E2%80%9D%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EA%20previous%20version%20of%20this%20article%20incorrectly%20stated%20that%20Donald%20Trump%20sold%20a%20superyacht%20to%20a%20Saudi%20prince.%20In%201991%2C%20the%20yacht%20in%20question%20was%20repossessed%20by%20the%20Boston%20Safe%20Deposit%20and%20Trust%20Company%2C%20a%20subsidiary%20of%20the%20Boston%20Company%2C%20itself%20a%20subsidiary%20of%20Shearson%20Lehman%20Brothers%2C%20when%20Trump%20defaulted%20on%20a%20loan.%20The%20yacht%20ended%20up%20in%20Prince%20Alwaleed%20bin%20Talal%E2%80%99s%20ownership%20as%20a%20result%20of%20a%20transaction%20between%20Shearson%20Lehman%20Brothers%20and%20Prince%20Alwaleed.%20An%20earlier%20version%20of%20the%20article%20also%20failed%20to%20include%20a%20denial%20from%20Ezra%20Cohen-Watnick%E2%80%99s%20attorney.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Schiff spent the run-up to the midterms travelling around the country campaigning to elect other Democrats to Congress. He went to twenty-five states and raised or contributed six and a half million dollars for other candidates—one of the highest totals for any Democrat outside the congressional leadership. Notably, his travels took him to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, which are early Presidential primary states. (In 2020, Schiff’s home state of California will be, too.) California’s two Senate seats are occupied by Democrats, and he faces a crowded field if he wants to move up in the ranks of the Democratic leadership in the House. A Cabinet post in a Democratic Administration would be another possibility. Schiff’s travels led some to speculate that he may be considering a long-shot bid for President in 2020. “It’s flattering to be asked the question,” he told me. “It’s hard for me to look beyond the big job I have on my plate right now, which is to oversee the intelligence agencies and do a thorough investigation and see if the President was compromised. I would never say never. I can’t see past the job I have to do right now.”"],["p","For the moment, the election results in the midterms gave Democrats in the House a sense of relief that borders, for some, on giddiness. Even Schiff seems jolly these days. With the move into the majority, his staff has more work, but also more room to breathe. Schiff’s elevated seniority has allowed his team to relocate to more commodious offices, which Schiff inherited from Darrell Issa, one of the many California Republicans whose congressional careers ended in 2018. Schiff mostly sticks to business with his staffers, but they all know that he was a movie buff long before he became the congressman from Hollywood. (Several years ago, his holiday gift to each staffer was a DVD of “The Big Lebowski,” which Schiff often quotes.) It’s less known that, like many lawyers in Los Angeles, Schiff has been writing screenplays on the side for years, which together amount to a kind of autobiography. “The first was a post-Holocaust story called ‘Remnant.’&nbsp;” As Schiff recalled, “I had an agent at William Morris tell me it was good but no one would want to see it—too depressing. Then ‘Schindler’s List’ came out, and I was, like, ‘Come on!’&nbsp;” His next, written when he was a prosecutor, was a murder mystery called “Minotaur.” “I had a friend who was a producer, and he said there were two answers in Hollywood—‘Yes,’ and ‘Here’s a check.’ I was getting lots of yeses.” But perhaps there is hope for his third. “It’s a spy drama,” he said. “That one is a work in progress.”&nbsp;♦"],["p","A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Donald Trump sold a superyacht to a Saudi prince.

even at this relatively late date in the history of forced or free American race-mixing, knows exactly what to do with the idea—or, worse, the reality—of a black body and a white body coming together. The problem is a superfluity of meaning. Sex between the races means rape and reconciliation, repression and release, assimilation and radical rejection, inculcation into one faulty set of values and freedom from another. Its participants are revolutionaries or self-haters, or both, and they are evidence of an old stain but also hints of a world to come."],["p","“Slave Play,” written by Jeremy&nbsp;O. Harris and directed by Robert O’Hara, at New York Theatre Workshop, takes this multivalent theme by the neck—also the waist; often the crotch—and never stops squeezing. The show’s disorienting first moments show Kaneisha, played with a hoarse drawl by Teyonah Parris, dressed in a slave’s rags and sweeping the floor. Floodlights flare, accompanied, oddly, by snippets of the song “Work,” by Rihanna, making Kaneisha dance. She grinds down to the floor, then pops her hind parts toward the ceiling. The image is uncomfortably funny and gruesomely sexy—like one of the violent, coital, comic scenes from Kara Walker’s recent painting ",["a",{"href":"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/274903"},"“Christ’s Entry Into Journalism”"],"—and a harbinger of things to come. A white man with a whip enters the room, interrupting the twerk, and we’re off."],["p","The play acts like a whittling knife, refining and clarifying as it cuts. The first act is broad and impressionistic, and each of the next two sections is more realistic and denser with psychic danger than the last. The back wall of the stage is a mirror; part of the point is your own reaction. Should you laugh or keep quiet? You can’t know until the ordeal is done—and even then, I can attest, the uncertainty may linger for days."],["p","Now is a good time to look away if you don’t want spoilers. After a series of sex sketches—a dildo-drunk mistress and a slave fiddler; a white indentured servant and the slave who has been assigned to oversee his work—something confusing happens. A white man, Jim (Paul Alexander Nolan), has wound his way, clumsily, toward slave-overseer sex with Kaneisha, who keeps asking him to call her a “Negress” and insists, despite his aversion, on calling him “Massa.” Suddenly, Jim cries out, “Starbucks! Starbucks!,” and people rush the stage, asking both if they’re O.K. I’ve never been so happily confused in the middle of a play. What gives?"],["p","It turns out that all three of the couples are participants in a study, engaging in “antebellum sexual performance therapy,” and now they sit in a semicircle, along with two therapists, Teá (Chalia La Tour) and Patricia (Irene Sofia Lucio). Each of the black partners has been inexplicably losing sexual interest, experiencing what Teá insists is a racial-romantic “anhedonia,” the inability to feel pleasure. What ensues is not only a deft exploration of what happens when love and power (acknowledged or not) collide but also an excavation of a newly common kind of political-academic talk."],["p","Harris shows, to very funny effect, how the language of critical theory—black studies, Marxist thought, queer and gender theories—and that of Freudian talk therapy have come, increasingly, to echo each other, sometimes fruitfully and sometimes not. Teá and Patricia ostentatiously “hear” each other and their subjects, and take stricken care with what they introduce into the “space.” Of course, these words mask coarser realities, chief among them the fact that the white participants insist on taking up more “space”—verbal and sometimes physical—than their partners."],["p","Part of what is irritating about our racial regime is its tendency to reduce us, without our consent and, often, before we even know it, to archetypes.

other day, Connie Britton, the actress, found herself at an indoor-outdoor furniture market in Malibu, shopping for items to fill a Spanish Colonial home that she had recently purchased. “I’m going to try to do a lot of vintage stuff from that period, but I love Art Deco and mid-century modern, too,” she said. She wore jeans and an olive-green sweater, and held a can of lime-flavored LaCroix. “I do think of interior design as an art form,” she said. Therefore, she had hired a professional. But comfortable seating defies outsourcing: Britton said she would test the chairs herself."],["p","Britton stars in the Bravo television drama “",["a",{"href":"https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/dirty-john-bravo-showrunner-interview.html"},"Dirty John"],",” based on a true-crime podcast about Debra Newell, an interior designer who gets duped by a handsome, sociopathic grifter. Britton plays Debra, a Maserati-driving self-made business owner and single mother, who founded her company in part to employ other single moms. “She’s actually an incredibly strong woman,” Britton said. She’s also a hopeless romantic, who speaks in breathy uptalk and fails to notice a parade of red flags flapping around her latest love interest. “It’s why Debra as a character is so fascinating,” Britton said. “Who she is to a man is what gives her value. Her ability to take care of him, to be loved by him, to give him what he needs, is as important—if not more important—than all the things that she’s capable of creating on her own.” She added, “To me, it’s a woman’s study.”"],["p","Britton, fifty-one, is famous for taking on a different type: voluminously haired Middle American moms who don’t take a lot of crap (Tami Taylor, in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Friday-Night-Lights-Kyle-Chandler/dp/B005CA4SOM"},"Friday Night Lights"],",” Rayna Jaymes, in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Nashville-Season-1/dp/B009M73DN8"},"Nashville"],"”). Her career took off around the time she turned forty—rare in Hollywood—and benefitted, she said, from “life experience.” She grew up in Maryland and Virginia, one of two daughters of a physicist and a homemaker. “My mom had a lot of Southern-lady friends, and they were, you know, ",["em","ladies"],",” she said, sinking into a cushy gray daybed. “But I was also brought up in a household where I was urged to pursue whatever I dreamed of doing.” So playing Debra required some digging: “For me to speak in her register, it shifts something internally.”"],["p","Britton paused in front of a comma-shaped lounge chair (price: $1,675) hanging from a thick tree branch. She jiggled its metal chain. “What if the tree breaks?” she asked. She hoisted herself in and lay back. Emboldened, she rushed over to a larger comma chair swaying from another tree. It bobbed from side to side as she attempted to get in. “Nope, no, not interested,” she said, letting it go. “No, thank you, no.”"],["p","Like Debra, Britton is a divorced single mother; she adopted her seven-year-old son, Yoby, in 2011. “I can certainly relate to a kind of ideal: ‘Oh, if only I had a partner, this wouldn’t be quite so difficult,’&nbsp;” she said. Can she relate to the bad online dates that Debra endures before meeting her charming con man? “I’m not ever going to go on a Web site,” she said. “I’d rather meet people through friends, and that can go just as badly.”"],["p","Among Britton’s friends is the New York senator ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/strong-vanilla"},"Kirsten Gillibrand"],". They attended Dartmouth together, and Gillibrand helped propel Britton into get-out-the-vote efforts. (On Election Day, she wore a sweater that said, in pink cursive script, “Nevertheless, she voted.”) The two women text frequently. “On the days when I feel really frustrated with what’s happening in the news, I’ll reach out to her and say, ‘Tell me the real deal, what do we need to do here, what can the average citizen do?’&nbsp;” Britton said. “Speaking to her is very soothing.” Gillibrand recently visited Yoby’s school to talk about her picture book about suffragists, “Bold &amp; Brave.”"],["p","An assortment of beanbag chairs had the give of packed soil; a velvet settee felt like “it’s got sand in it or something,” Britton said. She wryly regarded an assortment of fifty-nine-dollar woven baskets: “Like, if I only had those things, I could organize my entire house.”"],["p","Before leaving, she trekked to the market’s rest room, a faux-rustic windowed outhouse. Another shopper had accidentally locked the door on the way out. Britton flagged down a salesman. “Do you need to get in there?” he asked, not especially solicitous."],["p","Britton frowned. “Well, yeah,” she said."],["p","Afterward, she headed to her black S.U.V. The perfect chair was proving elusive. She’d find one another day.&nbsp;♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e7e716b454591adb2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Connie

about time. Some of us have been waiting all our lives, but, at last, she’s back. In “Mary Poppins Returns,” a small boy named Georgie Banks (Joel Dawson) goes to a park, in London, chasing an old kite that gets carried away by the wind. He grabs the string, and the string pulls him. Before he can be swept off, he is brought down to earth by Jack (",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/hamiltons"},"Lin-Manuel Miranda"],"), a friendly sort whose job is to light the city’s lamps, and who happens to be passing by. Together, he and Georgie tug at the string, but instead of a kite they reel in Mary Poppins (",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/emily-blunt"},"Emily Blunt"],"), the help from heaven. Lo! She comes with clouds descending, and Georgie runs home to spread the news. “I was flying a kite and it got caught on a nanny!” he declares."],["p","Thus begins Rob Marshall’s film, written by David Magee. Set during the “Great Slump,” presumably of the nineteen-thirties, it’s not a remake of the 1964 original, or a vain attempt to haul Mary into the modern age (although, God knows, we need her here), but a sequel, flush with newly minted songs. The manner of Mary’s return, summoned by a kite, is lifted from another sequel—“",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Poppins-Comes-Back-Travers/dp/0544439570/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="},"Mary Poppins Comes Back"],",” P.&nbsp;L.

At the end of it, Mary is asked where she’s from. “I’m at home,” she replies, “wherever I am!” Few fictional figures have been quite so self-possessed."],["p","The children from the first film, Jane and Michael Banks, are now grown up. Jane (",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/17/shades-of-the-suffragette-in-a-grownup-jane-banks"},"Emily Mortimer"],") is cheerful, single, and intent on improving the lives of working folk. (Well, up to a point. Although she carries flyers for a rally, we never see her attending it. In the 1964 movie, the kids’ mother sang lustily in favor of the suffragettes, whereas this version nods nervously at politics and hurries on by.) Michael (",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ben-whishaw"},"Ben Whishaw"],") has fared less well. He is widowed and woebegone, with three young offspring to care for: Annabel (Pixie Davies), John (Nathanael Saleh), and Georgie. There is a flustered housekeeper, Ellen (Julie Walters), who can barely keep control. Jane is doing her best to lend support, but money is tight, and their family house, 17 Cherry Tree Lane, is about to be repossessed. Only a miracle can save them. Hail Mary."],["p","How long does it take to be sure, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Blunt is right for the part? About two seconds, by my watch. Consider her first appearance, in the park. Fresh from on high, she lands not in a stutter or a rush but with one foot at a decorous angle and the other taking a gently purposeful stride. Nureyev could not have set her down with greater grace, and something about that initial step tells you all you need to know. (We sense at once a healthy impatience with fusspots and fools, for the grass, as the signs indicate, is not to be trodden on.) Whatever the job is, this Mary will get it done. “Snap! The job’s a game,” Julie Andrews informed us, more than half a century ago, when the role was hers. So what’s different, with Emily Blunt in charge?"],["p","A spoonful less sugar, I reckon, and a pinch more spice. A fraction of the lung power, as expected, though the accent is a touch posher, which makes you wonder what noble company Mary’s been keeping in the intervening years. An extra shade of slyness, too, is detectable in her sidelong glance, and in the curve of her smile, as though there were secrets neatly folded and tucked away in her carpetbag (which, like its owner, is infinite but bounded), rarely to be revealed. If Blunt is my favorite living actress, it’s partly because she brings to mind those other performers—no longer alive, but immortal—who traded with equal ease in the mystery of blithe spirits. Like Veronica Lake in “I Married a Witch” (1942), ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/carole-lombard"},"Carole Lombard"]," in her screwball heyday, and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/lauren-bacall"},"Lauren Bacall"]," in pretty much anything, Blunt requires an exceptionally good reason not to be amused. That’s why she sailed through “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/07/10/dressed-to-kill"},"The Devil Wears Prada"],"” (2006), why she was becalmed in the murk of “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/the-girl-on-the-train-and-under-the-shadow"},"The Girl on the Train"],"” (2016), and why there’s such a frothing sense of release, in “Mary Poppins Returns,” as she perches on the rim of a full bathtub, exclaims, “Off we go!,” and falls in."],["p","The children are already under the suds. There they discover an aquatic haven, where they bob along within giant bubbles; it’s just one of the playgrounds in which they are immersed at Mary’s command—or, rather, at the bidding of her imagination, which feels as strict as other people’s scoldings. Further exploits include a visit to her cousin Topsy (",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/meryl-streep"},"Meryl Streep"],"), whose bric-a-brac emporium turns upside down every second Wednesday of the month, and a frenzied nocturnal dance with Jack and his fellow-lamplighters. “China!” Mary says, when the children inquire where they will be heading next, though what she means is not the country but a porcelain bowl, prized and crazed, into which they somehow jump, and where the ground underfoot gives off a fragile ceramic ",["em","ding"],". The creatures who romp around them are animated cartoons, and the colors are a riot of candy stripes. Remind you of anything?"],["p","Almost every musical number in the new film is designed to match a sequence in the old one. Topsy is the answer to Mary’s buoyant uncle, who took tea on the ceiling; Jack is the nephew of Bert the chimney sweep, played by ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/13/supercalifragilistic"},"Dick Van Dyke"],", and “Trip a Little Light Fantastic,” the lamplighters’ chorus, picks up from “Step in Time,” the rooftop cry of the sweeps; and the trip inside the bowl mirrors “Jolly Holiday,” which began with a leap into a chalk drawing, roughly sketched on the sidewalk. Blunt even hushes the children with a lullaby, as Andrews did before."],["p","It’s far too soon to know whether the songs of today will stick, lodging in our collective ear as those of 1964 have done. What’s amazing is the tenacity with which the gods of Disney, for all the novelties of their digital art, have clung to the formulas of yore. You can find the sequel unadventurous in that regard, while still being seduced and soothed by its vow of innocence. Mary may be radical in her fancies; follow her lead, though, and you’ll find that her voyaging always brings you back to where you started, just as Dorothy, post-Oz, wakes up in her own warm bed. There is joy, not merely fear, in the wish to play things safe."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EMarshall%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20get%20everything%20right.%20Over%20the%20years%2C%20David%20Tomlinson%E2%80%99s%20performance%20as%20Mr.%20Banks%2C%20in%20%E2%80%9CMary%20Poppins%2C%E2%80%9D%20has%20grown%20peculiarly%20moving%20in%20its%20bluster%20and%20its%20bowler-hatted%20despair%20(%E2%80%9CA%20man%20has%20dreams%20of%20walking%20with%20giants%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20confessed)%2C%20whereas%20Ben%20Whishaw%2C%20as%20the%20latest%20man%20of%20the%20house%2C%20is%20craven%20and%20crushed.%20Julie%20Walters%2C%20offered%20pretty%20much%20the%20same%20part%20that%20she%20plays%20in%20the%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Frichard-brody%2Fthe-chilling-sweetness-of-paddington-2%5C%22%3EPaddington%3C%2Fa%3E%E2%80%9D%20films%2C%20obliges%20with%20an%20identical%20turn.%20At%20one%20point%2C%20we%20are%20confronted%20by%20BMX%20bikers%E2%80%94a%20spectacularly%20ill-judged%20addition%2C%20though%20it%20does%20drive%20home%20the%20firmness%20of%20period%20details%20elsewhere.%20The%20villains%2C%20naturally%2C%20are%20bankers%3B%20the%20more%20a%20movie%20costs%20to%20make%2C%20the%20more%20gleefully%20it%20must%20demonize%20the%20practice%20of%20basic%20capitalism.%20Having%20said%20that%2C%20the%20casting%20of%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fcolin-firth%5C%22%3EColin%20Firth%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20as%20the%20leading%20malefactor%2C%20is%20fiendishly%20smart%2C%20for%20which%20of%20us%20would%20not%20entrust%20our%20pennies%20to%20him%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOn%20the%20credit%20side%20of%20the%20ledger%2C%20there%20are%20rich%20rewards.%20Lin-Manuel%20Miranda%20kicks%20off%20the%20action%20not%20with%20a%20bang%20but%20with%20a%20wistful%2C%20Whistler-hued%20hymn%20to%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20lovely%20London%20sky%E2%80%9D%20(which%20is%20mostly%20gray)%2C%20and%20that%20restraint%20endures%2C%20though%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fhamilton%5C%22%3EHamilton%3C%2Fa%3E%E2%80%9D%20fans%20should%20not%20fret%3B%20one%20of%20his%20songs%2C%20packed%20with%20a%20patter%20of%20crispy%20consonants%20and%20delivered%20in%20double-quick%20time%2C%20is%20enough%20to%20convince%20us%20that%20hip-hop%20was%20born%20in%20the%20music%20hall.%20Drops%20of%20the%20old%20score%2C%20if%20you%20listen%20carefully%2C%20are%20melted%20into%20the%20soundtrack.%20There%20are%20cameos%20for%20Dick%20Van%20Dyke%2C%20who%20prances%20like%20it%E2%80%99s%201964%3B%20for%20Karen%20Dotrice%2C%20who%20was%20Jane%20all%20those%20years%20ago%2C%20and%20who%20now%20bumps%20into%20her%20adult%20self%3B%20and%20for%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fvideo.newyorker.com%2Fwatch%2Fangela-lansbury%5C%22%3EAngela%20Lansbury%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20whose%20very%20existence%20is%20a%20force%20of%20anti-gravity%2C%20as%20a%20seller%20of%20balloons.%20The%20tailoring%20is%20uniformly%20spiffy%20(Jane%20wears%20pants%20as%20wide%20as%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Fkatharine-hepburn%5C%22%3EKatharine%20Hepburn%E2%80%99s%3C%2Fa%3E)%2C%20and%20Mary%E2%80%99s%20shoes%20alone%20are%20worth%20the%20price%20of%20admission%2C%20especially%20the%20blue%20pair%20with%20the%20scarlet%20laces.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20short%2C%20those%20of%20us%20who%20pursue%20Mariolatry%E2%80%94the%20worship%20of%20all%20things%20Poppins%E2%80%94are%20free%20to%20delight%20in%20this%20film.%20Indeed%2C%20it%20shifts%20a%20little%20nearer%20than%20its%20predecessor%20did%20to%20the%20spiky%2C%20peppery%20briskness%20of%20Travers%E2%80%99s%20tales%2C%20and%20the%20whole%20enterprise%20exhales%2C%20as%20it%20should%2C%20an%20air%20of%20the%20politely%20mad.%20%E2%80%9CMary%20Poppins%2C%20how%20much%20do%20you%20weigh%3F%E2%80%9D%20one%20of%20the%20children%20asks%2C%20as%20they%20are%20all%20about%20to%20perch%20on%20Jack%E2%80%99s%20bicycle.%20Mary%E2%80%99s%20face%2C%20in%20response%2C%20is%20a%20picture%20of%20indignant%20horror.%20Manners%2C%20to%20her%2C%20are%20not%20a%20curb%20on%20emotion%2C%20or%20a%20falsifying%20mask%2C%20but%20vital%20accessories%20for%20getting%20on%20in%20the%20world%20or%20taking%20a%20principled%20stand.%20She%20is%20not%20old-fashioned%20in%20that%20belief.%20It%20simply%20means%2C%20as%20Julie%20Andrews%20suggested%2C%20and%20as%20Emily%20Blunt%20triumphantly%20confirms%2C%20that%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2005%2F12%2F19%2Fbecoming-mary-poppins%5C%22%3EMary%20Poppins%3C%2Fa%3E%20never%20goes%20out%20of%20style.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Marshall doesn’t get everything right. Over the years, David Tomlinson’s performance as Mr. Banks, in “Mary Poppins,” has grown peculiarly moving in its bluster and its bowler-hatted despair (“A man has dreams of walking with giants,” he confessed), whereas Ben Whishaw, as the latest man of the house, is craven and crushed. Julie Walters, offered pretty much the same part that she plays in the “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-chilling-sweetness-of-paddington-2"},"Paddington"],"” films, obliges with an identical turn. At one point, we are confronted by BMX bikers—a spectacularly ill-judged addition, though it does drive home the firmness of period details elsewhere.

Indeed, it shifts a little nearer than its predecessor did to the spiky, peppery briskness of Travers’s tales, and the whole enterprise exhales, as it should, an air of the politely mad. “Mary Poppins, how much do you weigh?” one of the children asks, as they are all about to perch on Jack’s bicycle. Mary’s face, in response, is a picture of indignant horror. Manners, to her, are not a curb on emotion, or a falsifying mask, but vital accessories for getting on in the world or taking a principled stand. She is not old-fashioned in that belief.

Interviewed in New York last week, Comey said that his own, possibly “weird” thought is that impeachment is not the ideal course; for one thing, it would let voters “off the hook” in 2020. “We need a clear jump upward, and it will come from tens of millions of Americans,” he told his interviewer, Nicolle Wallace. But Comey put the burden on the Democrats, saying, “They have to win.”"],["p","In response, Trump tweeted that Comey had “just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow Democrats to take back the White House in 2020.” (Comey says that he’s an independent.) He added, “Comey had no right heading the FBI at any time, but especially after his mind exploded!” The date and the circumstances of the alleged detonation were not clear, but the message was: to speak about confronting Trump at the polls is to speak as a Democrat."],["p","There’s some practical truth to that. Given that the Republicans, particularly in Congress, have largely ceded their party to Trump, the 2020 campaign seems headed toward a contest between him and the Democratic nominee. The Democrats now have to decide what kind of candidate they want. But why should the Republicans be let off the hook? Those who don’t share Trump’s more corrosive views often wallow in the perception of their own powerlessness. Yet they have options, if they choose to use them, including one that the Democrats don’t. They can challenge Trump in the primaries."],["p","Trump knows that, which is why his campaign is already working to engineer a preëmptive endorsement in the New Hampshire primary, the first in the nation, from the state Party, which traditionally remains neutral.

Ambassador with her dignity intact—a harder trick than winning some primaries—and may be positioning herself for a post-Trump moment. Why wait until 2024? Aside from Romney, several other senators could be potential challengers. Rob Portman, Kasich’s fellow-Ohioan, had considered running in 2016, and withdrew his endorsement of Trump after the “Access Hollywood” tape emerged.

took two minutes of Season 2 before someone said the words: “Gosh, you’re amazing.” The speaker was one of Miriam (Midge) Maisel’s colleagues at the B. Altman switchboard, but, really, it might have been anyone: a genius painter at the Cedar Inn, who says, “It’s like Vermeer painted you! Or you swallowed a light bulb”; a Johnny Mathis-esque crooner at a telethon; Lenny Bruce; Jane Jacobs; Midge’s estranged husband, Joel, who is still stuck on her; her boyfriend, a choosy doctor who prefers Midge to the vapid gold-diggers in the Catskills; her devoted agent, Susie; or even some Parisian drag queens, who dub her Miss America. Is there anyone who ",["em","doesn’t"]," love Midge?"],["p","Me, as it happens. Last year, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” was a boffo hit for Amazon and for its top-hatted creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino. The series swept the Emmys. It sent shivers of delight up the spines of vintage-shoppers everywhere. Lusciously art-directed, from Midge’s classic six to her kitten heels, the production landed at an ideal moment, tapping into a desperation—particularly among women—for something sweet and inspiring. No more “Handmaid’s Tale,” no more pussy-grabbing. “Mrs. Maisel” offered a bright-pink escape hatch from 2017."],["p","I craved such an escape myself—but I was also mystified by the show’s reception, because the first season struck me as both treacly and exhausting. This was true despite its having a premise that was so far up my alley it was practically chopping onions in my kitchen: a Jewish girl does standup comedy in the late nineteen-fifties in New York, when ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/last-girl-larchmont"},"Joan Rivers"]," first rose to fame. And, in fact, the show’s heroine, played by Rachel Brosnahan, is—exactly like Rivers was—a college-educated rich girl in her twenties, who is forced to move back home after her marriage blows up. When Midge enters show biz, her shtick, just like Rivers’s was, is to dress for a date, in a black dress and pearls, then free-associate truths about women’s lives. As with Rivers, the radical “sick” comic ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/24/lenny-again"},"Lenny Bruce"]," is Midge’s inspiration—and, in the show, Bruce (Luke Kirby) becomes her mentor. (In real life, after Rivers once bombed, Bruce left her a note: “You’re right, they’re wrong.” She kept it in her bra, for luck.)"],["p","But “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” makes two major adjustments. First, it gives Midge kids, a baby and a toddler. It also makes her a winner. Whereas Rivers was an alienated oddball, a loner fuelled by rejection, gagging onstage at her own “ugliness,” Midge is popular and pretty. She’s skilled (and brags of her skill) at everything from sex to brisket. When Joel, a wannabe comic, cheats with his secretary, Midge gets drunk and jumps onstage, and, right away, she kills. She keeps on killing—at cocktail parties and dive bars, even at a Washington Square rally, where she awes Jane Jacobs with a speech about how women “accessorize” the world, as a multiethnic crowd cheers. “Oh, that’s good, write that down,” Jacobs tells her assistant."],["p","Midge builds her “tight ten” routine faster than any comic ever, according to Susie (Alex Borstein), who gets teary at her client’s raw talent. (The butch Susie is so focussed on Midge’s prospects that she never gets a crush on her, or on anyone. Neither does Lenny Bruce. For a show about a woman who works blue, it’s oddly prudish.) By the finale of the first season, Midge has a dangerous enemy—Sophie Lennon (Jane Lynch), an older star who tells fat jokes, in a fat suit—but, as ever, she keeps killing, swatting down sexists. As the crowd roars, her louse of an ex wanders the street, moaning at her talent: “She’s ",["em","good"],". She’s ",["em","good"],".” The show is downright Sorkinian in its emphasis on Midge’s superiority—and more than a bit Streisandian, too, except that Midge starts ",["em","and"]," ends as a swan."],["p","Many people found this fantasy invigorating. For me, it felt grating, and not just in terms of verisimilitude—the verbal anachronisms (“totally”), the sitcom clams (“Good talk!”), the cloying Disneyfication of Midge’s Jewish family—but in its central psychology. In “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” sexism exists. But it never gets ",["em","inside"]," Midge. Her marvellousness comes from the fact that she’s immune, a self-adoring alpha whose routines feel like feminist ",["em",{"class":"small"},"TED"]," talks, with some “fucks” thrown in. Brosnahan delivers them with moxie, but they’re rarely funny. They’re also the opposite of Rivers’s act, which relied on the tension between looking pretty and ",["em","calling"]," herself a dog—provoking taboo laughs from the revelation that even this nice girl felt like a loser, desperate, unfuckable."],["p","In “Mrs. Maisel,” Rivers’s more unsettling qualities—her vengefulness, her perception of women as competitors, her eating disorder—all get displaced onto Midge’s foe, fat-joke Sophie, who lives in an opulent French-themed apartment, like the one Rivers lived in, collects furs, and, like the real Joan, wanted to be a serious actress.

me, when a TV hit unites women, it’s no fun to be Morales in “A Chorus Line,” feeling nothing.

Why nitpick? Why growl at Midge’s icebox parenting, which the show sees as adorable? Why kvetch about Midge’s greedy father-in-law, a portrait so coarse that it verges on anti-Semitism? Why mutter that, if the series hadn’t magically pushed Rivers’s night-club origins back into the fifties, it might have had to show her 1961 peers at the Gaslight Café, including Woody Allen and Bill Cosby, figures who are far tougher to sanitize?"],["p","So I tried to open my heart to Season 2. People grow, people change—even critics, even shows. But the season begins with a tooth-rottingly twee trip to Paris, followed by a cloying trip to the Catskills, a setting far better served by “Dirty Dancing.” It veers from one inconsistent family plot to another, with a baffling focus on Joel, who screws around but finds no one who lives up to his ex. (Despite its feminist theme, “Mrs. Maisel” has more one-line bimbos than “Entourage.”) There’s loads of ethnic shtick, from chain-smoking Frenchies to an Italian family singing “Funiculì, Funiculà.” Things perk up whenever the focus shifts to the salty, bruised Susie, a scrapper from the Rockaways—but even her plots are marred by dese-and-dose mobsters."],["p","The show’s writers do, to be fair, give their heroine more pushback this season. When she slams male comics (rightly, because they’re pigs), she loses gigs. When she gives a filthy toast at a Catholic wedding, the bride won’t forgive her. (I cheered.) When her dad catches her using him as material, he gives her the silent treatment. Her act rarely matches her charmed life—why would Midge, so wooed and worshipped, rave about how women are experts on rejection?—but Brosnahan jolts each bit with charisma. Yet, by the finale, nothing adds up. When the season lands on a note of darkness, tied to Lenny Bruce’s routine “All Alone,” it feels unearned. Why should Midge choose art over love? Her patient, supportive boyfriend ",["em","and"]," her ex think that she’s a comic genius. Her childcare is free (and often invisible). No force keeps her from having both, other than her own unacknowledged solipsism."],["p","There are better escape hatches.

Julie Kavner stars as Dottie Ingels, a divorced Jewish comedian from New York, whose quest for fame leads her to ditch her kids. The movie manages to celebrate that choice without stacking the deck. It’s realistic about a sexist industry. It treats Dottie’s children as real people, who are as interesting as she is. It even manages to be funny. There’s more than one way to have it all.&nbsp;♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5910eeb86c4c222f03a85a53","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5910eeb86c4c222f03a85a53","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"On Television","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"on-television"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Emily Nussbaum","type":"author","title":"Emily Nussbaum, \u003cem&gt;The New Yorker\u003c/em&gt;’s television critic, won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for criticism.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Emily Nussbaum is the television critic for ",["em","The New Yorker"]," and, in 2016, won the Pulitzer Prize for criticism.
